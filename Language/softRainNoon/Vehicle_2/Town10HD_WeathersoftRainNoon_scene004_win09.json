  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.1 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a rainy city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a red truck on the left side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building in the background. The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet from the rain, and the driver needs to be cautious. The frequent braking events are likely due to the rainy conditions, as the driver needs to slow down and stop more often to avoid potential accidents. The presence of other cars on the road also requires the driver to be attentive and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
