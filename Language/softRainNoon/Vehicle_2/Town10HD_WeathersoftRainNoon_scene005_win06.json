  "title": "Rainy city street with parked cars and a blue car driving in the distance.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy day, passing parked cars and a blue car in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The blue car is driving in the distance, and the ego vehicle is moving slowly. There are no other moving vehicles or pedestrians visible in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is likely driving slowly due to the rainy conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the parked cars and the blue car in the distance to avoid any potential accidents. The rainy weather also means that the braking distance is increased, so the driver needs to be extra cautious and attentive to the road conditions."
