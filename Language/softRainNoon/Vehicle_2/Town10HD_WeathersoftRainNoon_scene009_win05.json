  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a motorcycle rider.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There is a motorcycle rider in the right lane. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are braking or stopping.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested and the drivers are trying to avoid accidents. The tall buildings in the background give an impression of a busy city center."
