  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs visible in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy weather conditions. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the cars ahead. The rain is making it more difficult to see the road clearly and anticipate the movements of other vehicles."
