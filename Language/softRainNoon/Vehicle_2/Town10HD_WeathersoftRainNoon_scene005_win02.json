  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy day in a busy city street, with a blue car in front and a tall building in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large roundabout ahead. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and following a blue car in front of it. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalks.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it. It slows down or brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents. The tall building in the background adds to the urban atmosphere of the scene."
