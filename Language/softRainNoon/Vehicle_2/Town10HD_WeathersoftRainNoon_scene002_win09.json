  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red SUV drives slowly down a rainy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the street, including a blue car and a parked black truck. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is overcast and gloomy, with rain falling heavily.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents, given the high number of braking events in the driving metadata. The presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the street requires the driver to remain vigilant and cautious, adjusting speed and distance accordingly."
