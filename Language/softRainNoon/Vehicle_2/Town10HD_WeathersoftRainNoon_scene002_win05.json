  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy day in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.3 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are tall buildings on either side of the street. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is slightly reduced.",

The driver is cautious and pays close attention to the traffic lights and the surrounding environment to ensure safe navigation through the city."
