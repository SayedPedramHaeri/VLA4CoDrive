  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopping at the intersection. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet from the rain. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions, and it is approaching an intersection where it must stop. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The presence of tall buildings suggests that this is a busy city street, and the driver must be attentive to potential hazards such as pedestrians and other vehicles. The rainy weather also means that the road is slippery, and the driver must be careful not to lose control of the vehicle."
