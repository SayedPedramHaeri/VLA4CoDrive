  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly in a busy city intersection on a rainy day.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars and a motorcycle driving around. The traffic lights are red, and the pedestrians are wearing raincoats. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, trying to avoid any accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions, which can make the road slippery and more difficult to control. The driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles around them to ensure safe navigation through the intersection."
