  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives through a rainy city street with tall buildings and a blue car in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and braking frequently.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, braking frequently to avoid potential accidents. The tall buildings on the right side of the road may cause some visibility issues, but the traffic lights are clearly visible in the distance. The presence of other cars on the street requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for sudden braking or changes in direction."
