  "title": "Rainy city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side, stopping at a red light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are tall buildings on either side of the street. The weather is overcast and gloomy, with visibility slightly reduced by the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions and the frequent braking of other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the surrounding environment, preparing to stop or change lanes as needed. The tall buildings on either side of the street create a canyon-like effect, which can make it more difficult to see and anticipate potential hazards."
