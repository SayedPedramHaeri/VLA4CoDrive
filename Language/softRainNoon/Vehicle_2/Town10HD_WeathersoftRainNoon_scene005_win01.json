  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.1 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a rainy city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car in the distance and a parked truck on the right side of the road. The road is wet from the rain, and there are several traffic lights and signs visible along the street. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is slightly reduced due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet from the rain, and the driver needs to maintain control of the vehicle. The frequent braking events are likely due to the rainy conditions, as the driver needs to slow down and stop more frequently to avoid potential accidents. The driver is also paying close attention to the traffic lights and signs along the street to ensure safe navigation through the city."
