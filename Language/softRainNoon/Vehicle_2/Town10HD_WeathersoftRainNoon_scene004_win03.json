  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopping at the intersection. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet from the rain. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions, and it is approaching an intersection where it must stop. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road, and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The rainy weather and wet road surface may make it more difficult to see and react to potential hazards, so the driver is exercising caution and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles."
