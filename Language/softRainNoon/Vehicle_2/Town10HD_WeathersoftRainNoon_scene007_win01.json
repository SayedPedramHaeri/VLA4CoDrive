  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in a city street with palm trees and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a wet city street with palm trees on both sides of the road. There are multiple traffic lights and a few parked cars. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The road is wet, and there are several braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather and the wet road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The multiple braking events or strong decelerations indicate that the traffic is heavy, and the driver is constantly adjusting the speed to avoid collisions. The presence of palm trees and traffic lights suggest that this is a busy urban area with a mix of pedestrians and vehicles. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging driving conditions."
