  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate braking",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain control on the wet road. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver must be cautious and attentive to the changing traffic conditions and the visibility impaired by the rain."
