  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving with almost no speed, stopping at intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving with almost no speed, stopping at intersection. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also stopping at the intersection. The traffic lights are red and the pedestrians are waiting to cross the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, approaching an intersection. It slows down even more and stops because the traffic light is red and there are pedestrians waiting to cross the street. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safety. The rain and low visibility make the driving conditions more challenging, so the driver needs to be extra careful and attentive to avoid any accidents."
