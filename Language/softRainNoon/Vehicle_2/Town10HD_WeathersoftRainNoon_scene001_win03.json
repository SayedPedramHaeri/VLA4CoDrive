  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, 8 braking events",
  "caption": "A woman on a bike crosses a rainy city street while the ego vehicle drives at moderate speed.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.3 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The woman on the bike crosses the street while the ego vehicle drives at moderate speed. The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars and pedestrians in the scene. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is rainy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at moderate speed because it is following the speed limit and the traffic flow. The woman on the bike crosses the street safely because she is using the designated crosswalk and the ego vehicle is paying attention to her. The 8 braking events could be due to other cars stopping or slowing down in the rain, or the ego vehicle reacting to pedestrians or obstacles on the road."
