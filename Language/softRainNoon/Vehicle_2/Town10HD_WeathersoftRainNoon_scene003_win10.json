  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a rainy city intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly through a rainy city intersection. There are several other cars on the road, including a white van and a parked blue car. The road is wet and visibility is slightly reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights at the intersection, which are currently red for the blue car.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the intersection because it is raining and visibility is reduced. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The presence of other cars on the road and the red traffic light indicate that the driver needs to stop. The driver is also maintaining a safe distance from the white van in front of them to avoid any potential collisions."
