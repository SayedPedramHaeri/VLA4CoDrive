  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car in the distance. The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall palm trees lining the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building in the background. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly down the rainy city street because of the wet road conditions and the presence of other vehicles. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and that the other drivers are also adjusting their speed to the rainy conditions. The red car is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles and is prepared to brake or change lanes as needed to avoid any potential accidents."
