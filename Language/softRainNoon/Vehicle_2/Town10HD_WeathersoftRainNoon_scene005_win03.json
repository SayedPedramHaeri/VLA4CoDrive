  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly through a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy day. There are tall buildings on the right side of the street. A blue car is parked on the side of the road. The road is wet from the rain. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are braking or slowing down.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the road is slippery and the other cars are trying to maintain safe distances. The red car is following the blue car at a safe distance, and it is also slowing down to avoid collisions with other cars on the road."
