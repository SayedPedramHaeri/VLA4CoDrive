  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly through a rainy city intersection, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly through a busy city intersection. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car and a white car. The road is wet from the rain, and there are traffic lights and pedestrians visible. The weather is overcast and foggy, reducing visibility.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly through the intersection because of the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and that the other drivers are also being cautious. The red car is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles and is prepared to stop or change lanes as needed."
