  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. It is almost stopped at an intersection. There are other cars on the road, including a white van and a parked blue car. The road is wet from the rain. The traffic lights are visible and they are red.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching an intersection and is about to stop. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The parked blue car and the white van are also visible on the road, and the driver is paying attention to their positions to avoid any potential collisions."
