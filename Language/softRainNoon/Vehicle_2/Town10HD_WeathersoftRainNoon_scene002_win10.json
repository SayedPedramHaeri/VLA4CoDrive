  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A red SUV drives through a rainy intersection in a busy city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red SUV driving through a busy city intersection on a rainy day. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. The SUV is driving at a slow speed and there are other vehicles on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the background and they are showing red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The red SUV is driving cautiously through the rainy intersection because of the reduced visibility and wet road. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road to avoid any accidents. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be extra careful while navigating through the intersection."
