  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street, and the road is wet. The traffic is light, and there are a few parked cars on the side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green and red lights.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly on the rainy city street to ensure safety. The driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions and the reduced visibility. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is reacting to potential hazards on the road, such as pedestrians or other vehicles. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and adjusting their speed accordingly. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging weather conditions."
