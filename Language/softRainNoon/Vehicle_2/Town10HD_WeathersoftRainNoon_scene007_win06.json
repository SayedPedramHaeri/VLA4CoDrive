  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet due to the rain. The weather is cloudy and gloomy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested, and the drivers are trying to avoid accidents. The tall buildings on both sides of the road indicate that this is a busy city street. The ego vehicle is following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any potential collisions."
