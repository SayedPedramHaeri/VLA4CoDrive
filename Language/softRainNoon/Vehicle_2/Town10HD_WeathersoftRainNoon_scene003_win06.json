  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes frequently due to the wet road surface and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. The driver must remain vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other cars to avoid potential collisions."
