  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy day in a busy city street, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is slightly reduced. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following a blue car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. There are also a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the car in front of it to avoid any potential accidents due to the rainy weather. It also adjusts its speed according to the traffic conditions and the visibility on the road. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and attentive to the surroundings."
