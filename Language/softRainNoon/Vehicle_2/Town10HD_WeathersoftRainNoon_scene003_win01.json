  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle at intersection, following a black car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.5 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle at intersection, following a black car. The road is wet and slippery, and visibility is low. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking or stopping. The traffic lights are red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully to avoid any accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rainy weather conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and following the black car in front of them to avoid any sudden braking or changes in direction. The driver is also keeping a safe distance from the other vehicles and obeying the traffic signals to ensure a safe journey. The rainy weather and the presence of pedestrians on the street require the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive to avoid any accidents or collisions."
