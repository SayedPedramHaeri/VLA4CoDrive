  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. It is approaching an intersection with a white bus and a red car on the road. There are tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk. The road is wet and there are white lines on the pavement.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching the intersection and preparing to stop. The white bus and the red car are ahead of the blue car. The tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk suggest that this is a city street. The wet road and the white lines on the pavement indicate that the road is slippery and the driver needs to be cautious."
