  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.7 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet from the rain. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be attentive to avoid collisions. The parked truck on the right side of the street could also be a potential obstacle for the driver to navigate around."
