  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue sports car drives slowly through a rainy city intersection, with a red truck and a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue sports car is driving slowly through a rainy city intersection. There is a red truck and a bus behind it. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and pedestrians present in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The blue sports car is driving slowly through the rainy city intersection because it is almost stopped. The driver is being cautious due to the wet road and reduced visibility. The red truck and the bus are following the blue sports car at a safe distance. The traffic lights are visible in the scene and the pedestrians are crossing the road at the crosswalk. The driver is paying attention to the surroundings and the potential risks, such as the parked vehicles and the pedestrians, in order to ensure a safe driving experience."
