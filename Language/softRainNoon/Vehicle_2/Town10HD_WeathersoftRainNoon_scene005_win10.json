  "title": "Rainy city street driving at moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street at moderate speed, with other cars and pedestrians visible.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. Some of the cars are closer to the front of the ego vehicle, while others are further away. There are also a few pedestrians visible on the sidewalks. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are currently displaying green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It is keeping a safe distance from the other cars and is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians to avoid any accidents. The rain is reducing visibility slightly, but the driver is still able to see the road and the surrounding environment clearly."
