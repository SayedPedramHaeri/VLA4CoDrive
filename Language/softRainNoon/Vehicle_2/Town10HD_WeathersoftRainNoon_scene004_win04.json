  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with blue car in front.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wide city street with tall buildings on both sides. The road is wet and slippery. The ego vehicle is almost stopped at an intersection with a red traffic light. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also stopping at the intersection. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas. The weather is cloudy and gloomy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles at the intersection. It is important to maintain a safe distance from the car in front to avoid collisions. The red traffic light indicates that the ego vehicle should stop and wait for the light to turn green before proceeding. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are also affected by the rain and may be more difficult to see, so the ego vehicle should be extra cautious when approaching the intersection."
