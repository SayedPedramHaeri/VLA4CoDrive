  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. It is approaching an intersection with a white bus and a red car on the road. There are tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk. The road is wet and there are white lines on the pavement.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching the intersection and needs to be cautious of other vehicles on the road. The white bus and red car are ahead of the blue car, and the blue car needs to maintain a safe distance from them. The tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk indicate that the blue car is in a city environment. The wet road and white lines on the pavement suggest that the blue car needs to be careful and attentive while driving."
