  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly through a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy day. There are many other cars on the road, and some of them are braking or stopping. The traffic lights are mostly red, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road is wet and slippery, and the visibility is reduced due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or stops whenever it detects a potential hazard, such as a car braking suddenly or a pedestrian crossing the street. The car's sensors detect the braking events and adjust the speed accordingly. The car also keeps a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid collisions. Overall, the car's behavior is cautious and defensive to ensure the safety of its passengers and other road users."
