  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. It is almost stopped at an intersection. There are other cars on the road, including a parked white van on the right side of the road. The road is wet from the rain. There are traffic lights at the intersection, and the blue car is following the traffic rules.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. It is almost stopped at an intersection because it is following the traffic rules and being cautious due to the wet road conditions. The car is braking frequently, with 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window, to ensure safe driving. The car is also maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road, including the parked white van on the right side of the road. The car is obeying the traffic lights at the intersection and waiting for its turn to move."
