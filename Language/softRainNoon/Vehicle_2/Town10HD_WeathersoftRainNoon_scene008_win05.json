  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle navigates a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a slow-moving vehicle driving on a rainy city street. The road is wet, and there are several other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The video captures multiple braking events, with the ego vehicle braking 11 times or experiencing strong decelerations. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy day, which requires it to be extra cautious. The multiple braking events suggest that the vehicle is reacting to the changing traffic conditions and trying to avoid collisions. The presence of the pedestrian and the red traffic light indicate that the vehicle is following traffic rules and prioritizing safety. The parked truck on the right side of the road adds to the complexity of the driving situation, as the vehicle needs to navigate around it while maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
