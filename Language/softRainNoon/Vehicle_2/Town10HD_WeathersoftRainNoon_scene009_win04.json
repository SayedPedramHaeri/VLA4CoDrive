  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy day, almost stopped at intersection, other cars and pedestrians on the road",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy day, almost stopped at intersection, other cars and pedestrians on the road, traffic lights and street signs visible",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection, waiting for the traffic light to change. There are other cars and pedestrians on the road, and the rainy weather makes the road slippery. The ego vehicle needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any accidents."
