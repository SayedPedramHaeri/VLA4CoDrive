  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a roundabout.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are multiple cars and a roundabout in the scene. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching a roundabout and there are multiple cars on the road. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any accidents. The rain reduces visibility and makes the road slippery, so the driver needs to be extra careful and attentive to the traffic situation."
