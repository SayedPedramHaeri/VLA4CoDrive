  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopping at the intersection. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet from the rain. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions, and it is approaching an intersection where it must stop. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The presence of tall buildings suggests that this is a busy urban area, and the driver must be extra vigilant to avoid any potential accidents. The rain and wet road surface may make it more difficult to brake in time, so the driver is being particularly cautious and attentive to the traffic situation."
