  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. It is almost stopped at an intersection. There are other cars on the road, including a red car and a white bus. The road is wet from the rain. There are tall buildings and palm trees lining the street. The traffic light is red.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rain and the stop sign at the intersection. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions and the presence of pedestrians near the crosswalk. The car is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles."
