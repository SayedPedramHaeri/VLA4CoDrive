  "title": "Rainy city driving, slowing to stop at intersection.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the corner of the intersection. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following the car in front of it.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the potential for reduced visibility. It is also slowing to stop at the intersection, following traffic rules and ensuring safety. The presence of other cars on the road and the large building on the corner suggest that this is a busy city street, requiring extra caution while driving."
