  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.1 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy city street with tall buildings on both sides. The road is wet and slippery. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and frequently brakes. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is raining and the road is slippery. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other cars on the road. The driver of the ego vehicle is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road require the driver to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other cars. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is prioritizing safety over speed."
