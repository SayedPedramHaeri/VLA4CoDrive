  "title": "Rainy city driving with a slow-moving vehicle and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle drives down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a slow-moving vehicle driving down a rainy city street. The road is wet and slippery, and there are multiple braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The traffic situation is moderate, with other vehicles and pedestrians visible in the distance. The weather is rainy, and visibility is slightly reduced. There are no important traffic lights, stop signs, or crossings in the frame.",
  "reasoning": "The slow-moving vehicle is likely driving cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions. The multiple braking events or strong decelerations could be caused by the slippery road surface or other vehicles suddenly stopping or changing lanes. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians, and it is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The driver is being extra cautious to ensure the safety of the passengers and other road users."
