  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. It is approaching an intersection with a red traffic light. There are other cars on the road, including a red truck and a white car. The road is wet from the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching the intersection and preparing to stop because of the red traffic light. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The wet road surface could cause reduced visibility and longer braking distances, so the driver is being extra careful."
