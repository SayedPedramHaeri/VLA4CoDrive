  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and stops at the intersection, checking for oncoming traffic before proceeding. The presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the street requires the driver to remain vigilant and cautious, adjusting speed and distance accordingly."
