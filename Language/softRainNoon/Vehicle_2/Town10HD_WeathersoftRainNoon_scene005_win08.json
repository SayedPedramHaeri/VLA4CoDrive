  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy day on a city street with moderate speed and occasional braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving straight and changing lanes occasionally.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety on the wet road. It brakes occasionally to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is cautious and attentive to the traffic signals and the surrounding environment. The tall building on the right side of the road is an important landmark for navigation purposes."
