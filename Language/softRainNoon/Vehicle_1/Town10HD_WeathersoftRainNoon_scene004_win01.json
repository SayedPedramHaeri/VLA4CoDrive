  "title": "Rainy city street with parked truck and traffic lights.",
  "caption": "The white van is driving slowly on a rainy city street with a tall building in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there is a parked truck on the left side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are other cars driving in the opposite direction. The white van is driving slowly and carefully, following the traffic rules.",
  "reasoning": "The rainy weather reduces visibility and can make the road slippery, so the white van is driving slowly to ensure safety. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road, and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary."
