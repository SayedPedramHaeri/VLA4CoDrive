  "title": "Rainy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle on a rainy day in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a slow-moving vehicle on a rainy day in a city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the background and they are displaying red and green lights. The video captures the raindrops hitting the windshield of the vehicle and the sound of the rain adds to the atmosphere of the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is moving slowly due to the rainy weather conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The parked truck on the side of the road may have obstructed the driver's view of upcoming traffic, leading to the need for frequent braking. The driver is also following the traffic light signals, which are displaying red and green lights. Overall, the video captures the challenges of driving in rainy weather conditions and the importance of being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
