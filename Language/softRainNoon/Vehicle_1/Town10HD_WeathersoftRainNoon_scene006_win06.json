  "title": "Rainy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A person is driving a car in the rain on a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a roundabout ahead. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The rain reduces visibility and makes the road slippery, so the driver needs to be extra cautious. The multiple braking events suggest that there may be heavy traffic or unexpected obstacles ahead. The driver is likely using the brakes to slow down and come to a complete stop at the roundabout."
