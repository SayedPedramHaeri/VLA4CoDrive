  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, following a red truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic light ahead is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is overcast, and visibility is slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the red truck in front of it, and it slows down as it approaches the red traffic light. It is prepared to stop or turn left if necessary. The pedestrian crossing the street is also taken into account, and the ego vehicle adjusts its speed accordingly."
