  "title": "Rainy city street driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street, passing parked cars and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the street. The traffic is light, with only a few cars visible in the distance. The pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk and appears to be crossing the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green and red lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It is keeping a safe distance from the parked cars and the pedestrian, and it is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road to ensure a safe journey."
