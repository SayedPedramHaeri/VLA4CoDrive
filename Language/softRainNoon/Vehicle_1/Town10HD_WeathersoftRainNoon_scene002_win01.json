  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street with rain and multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.7 m/s). There are 16 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the braking cars.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of multiple braking events. It is changing lanes to avoid getting too close to the cars in front of it, and it is slowing down to maintain a safe distance. The large building on the right side of the road may be an indication of an upcoming intersection or roundabout."
