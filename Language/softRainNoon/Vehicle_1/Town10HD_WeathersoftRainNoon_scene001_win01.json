  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.7 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate. There are several parked cars on the side of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the weather is rainy and the road is wet. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The frequent braking events are likely due to the rainy conditions and the need to slow down and stop for other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the surrounding environment to ensure safe driving."
