  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy day in a busy city, with many other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.9 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving at different speeds. Some of them are changing lanes or turning left. There are also a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk or crossing the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they seem to be working properly. The weather is quite gloomy, with gray and overcast skies.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes when approaching intersections or when other vehicles or pedestrians are nearby. The driver also keeps a safe distance from the cars in front to avoid any potential collisions. The rainy weather requires extra caution and attention to the surroundings to ensure a safe driving experience."
