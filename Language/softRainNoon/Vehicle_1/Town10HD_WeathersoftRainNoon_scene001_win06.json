  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city, with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road. The visibility is moderate, and the weather is rainy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid skidding on the wet road. It stops at the red traffic light and waits for the light to turn green. The bus behind it is also driving slowly, maintaining a safe distance. The parked truck on the side of the road is not obstructing traffic, and the other cars on the street are also driving carefully due to the rainy conditions."
