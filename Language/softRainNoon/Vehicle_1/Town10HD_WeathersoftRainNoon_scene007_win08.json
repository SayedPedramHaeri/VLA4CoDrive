  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly in a busy city intersection on a rainy day.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving around. The traffic light is red, and the pedestrians are waiting to cross the street. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the busy intersection. It is approaching the red traffic light, and the pedestrians are waiting to cross the street. The parked truck on the side of the road may have obstructed the view of the road ahead, which could be one of the reasons why the ego vehicle is driving slowly. The rainy weather conditions may also have affected the visibility of the road, making it difficult for the ego vehicle to see the road ahead clearly."
