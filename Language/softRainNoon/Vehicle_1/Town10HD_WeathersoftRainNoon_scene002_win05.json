  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and 4 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy day in a busy city, following a white car and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 4 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It follows the white car in front and changes lanes to avoid potential obstacles. The braking events are likely due to the slippery road surface and the need to slow down or stop for traffic signals or pedestrians."
