  "title": "Rainy city street driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street, passing a tall building and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic light ahead is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It keeps a safe distance from the parked truck and other vehicles on the road. As the traffic light turns red, the ego vehicle slows down and prepares to stop. The pedestrian crossing the street is also a safety consideration, and the ego vehicle remains vigilant to avoid any accidents."
