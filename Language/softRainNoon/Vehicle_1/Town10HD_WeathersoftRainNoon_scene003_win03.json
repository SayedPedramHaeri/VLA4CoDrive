  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, including a white car in front of the ego vehicle. The traffic lights are green, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to maintain safety and avoid potential accidents. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested and the vehicles are stopping frequently. The white car in front of the ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance, and the pedestrians on the sidewalk are also affected by the rainy weather. The green traffic lights indicate that the ego vehicle has the right of way, but it is important to remain cautious and vigilant in these conditions."
