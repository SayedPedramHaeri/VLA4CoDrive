  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a rainy city intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly through a busy city intersection. There are several other cars on the road, including a black car and a white car. The road is wet from the rain, and there are traffic lights and pedestrians crossing the street. The weather is overcast and gloomy.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the intersection because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The presence of other cars and pedestrians on the road requires the driver to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance from them. The driver is also obeying the traffic light signals and waiting for the right time to proceed."
