  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white car drives through an intersection in the rain, with a bus and a red car behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several vehicles on the street, including a white bus and a red car. The traffic light is green, and there is a tall building in the background. The video shows the ego vehicle slowing down and stopping at the intersection.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles around it. It slows down and stops at the intersection, following the traffic rules and ensuring safety. The presence of the bus and the red car behind it suggests that the traffic is heavy, and the driver needs to be extra careful while navigating through the intersection."
