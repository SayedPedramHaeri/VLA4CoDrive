  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopping at the intersection. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet from the rain. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The white car is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is approaching an intersection, where it is stopping to wait for the traffic light to change. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road, taking into account the wet road conditions and the potential for reduced visibility. The car is braking frequently, likely in response to changes in the traffic flow or to maintain its speed. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging weather conditions."
