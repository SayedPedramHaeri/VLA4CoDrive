  "title": "Rainy city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side, stopping at a red light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 17 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large roundabout ahead. The weather is overcast and gloomy, with visibility slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy conditions and the high frequency of braking by other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles, and is prepared to stop or change lanes as needed to maintain safety. The large roundabout ahead may require the driver to adjust their speed and path to navigate it smoothly."
