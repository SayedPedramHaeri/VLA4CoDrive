  "title": "Rainy city street driving with 12 braking events",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a rainy day in a city street with many other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are many other cars and pedestrians around. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid collisions. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalks.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, braking frequently to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. The rain reduces visibility and makes the road slippery, so the driver needs to be extra careful. The ego vehicle is following the traffic rules and trying to avoid any sudden movements that could lead to accidents. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and other road signs to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
