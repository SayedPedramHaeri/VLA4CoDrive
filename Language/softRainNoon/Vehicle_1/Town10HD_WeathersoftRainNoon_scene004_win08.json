  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street, braking frequently and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid potential accidents with other vehicles on the road. The driver is also changing lanes to avoid congestion and maintain a safe distance from other cars. The tall building on the right side of the road is an important landmark for navigation purposes."
