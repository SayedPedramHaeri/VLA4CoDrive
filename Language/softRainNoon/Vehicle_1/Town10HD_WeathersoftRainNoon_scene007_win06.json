  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly in rainy city, stopping at intersection with pedestrian and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city street with tall buildings, palm trees, and parked cars. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping at an intersection. There is a pedestrian crossing the street and a traffic light with a green light. The road is wet from the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to maintain visibility and avoid hydroplaning. It stops at the intersection to let the pedestrian cross safely and to follow the traffic light signals. The driver is cautious and pays attention to potential risks such as slippery roads and reduced visibility."
