  "title": "Rainy city driving with a slow-moving blue car and a white bus in the background.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with a white bus in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.7 m/s). There are 22 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There is a white bus in the background. The road is wet and there are other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The white bus in the background is also driving slowly, following the same safety precautions. The wet road surface increases the braking distance and requires the drivers to be more attentive to avoid any accidents."
