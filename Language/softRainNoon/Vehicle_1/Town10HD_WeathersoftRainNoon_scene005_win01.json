  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, 1 braking event",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street, with moderate speed and one braking event.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.9 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building in the background. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving straight, following a white car in front of it.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes when necessary to avoid potential accidents. The driver is cautious and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The tall building in the background serves as a landmark to help navigate the city streets."
