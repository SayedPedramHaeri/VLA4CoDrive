  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A person is driving a car on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.7 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is cloudy and dark, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving in the right lane, and there is a blue car in the left lane.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy weather conditions. The frequent braking events are likely due to the slippery road surface caused by the rain. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The tall building on the right side of the road is an important landmark for navigation purposes. The driver is following the traffic rules and regulations, and the traffic lights are being obeyed to ensure safe driving."
