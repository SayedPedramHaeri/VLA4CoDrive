  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side and a red stop sign on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.1 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the street. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid potential risks from the parked cars and pedestrians crossing the street. The red stop sign on the right indicates that the ego vehicle should be cautious and prepared to stop if necessary."
