  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white van drives straight on a rainy city street, with a small white car in the left lane.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars and a bus on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building in the background. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The white van is driving carefully due to the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It maintains a safe distance from the small white car in the left lane and slows down as it approaches the intersection. The van is prepared to stop or turn left if necessary, taking into account the potential risks of pedestrians or merging traffic."
