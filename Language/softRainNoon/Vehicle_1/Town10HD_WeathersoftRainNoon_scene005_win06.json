  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and occasional braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy day on a city street with moderate speed and occasional braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and adjusting its speed according to the traffic conditions. It slows down when approaching intersections or areas with heavy traffic. The rain makes the road slippery, so the vehicle needs to be cautious and maintain a steady speed to avoid any accidents."
