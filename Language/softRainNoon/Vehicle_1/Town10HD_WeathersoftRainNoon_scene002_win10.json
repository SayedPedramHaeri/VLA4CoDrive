  "title": "Rainy city street with moderate traffic, ego vehicle almost stopped.",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly in a rainy city street with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy city street with moderate traffic. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and is almost stopped. There are other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs visible in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in order to maintain control on the wet road. The driver is being cautious due to the rainy weather conditions. The braking events observed in the metadata suggest that other vehicles on the road are also adjusting their speed accordingly. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and street signs to ensure safe navigation through the city street."
