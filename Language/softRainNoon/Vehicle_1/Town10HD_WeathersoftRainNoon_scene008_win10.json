  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A car drives slowly through a rainy city intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The car is driving slowly through a busy city intersection. There are several other cars and pedestrians around, and the traffic lights are red. The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The car is driving slowly because it is approaching a busy intersection with several other cars and pedestrians around. The driver is being cautious due to the rainy weather and the potential for reduced visibility. The car is braking frequently to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead, and the driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and other road users to ensure a safe passage through the intersection."
