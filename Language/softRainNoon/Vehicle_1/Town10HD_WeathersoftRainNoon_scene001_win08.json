  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white bus drives down a rainy city street with a red car and a white car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain. The white bus is driving down the street, followed by a red car and a white car. There are several other cars on the road, including one that is parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building in the background. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection, waiting for the traffic light to change. The white bus is driving down the street, and the red car is following closely behind. The white car is also driving down the street, but it is further away. The parked car on the side of the road is not causing any obstruction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the tall building in the background suggests that this is a downtown area. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle should remain cautious and alert to avoid any potential accidents."
