  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy city street with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is maintaining a safe distance from the front car and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and pedestrians to ensure safe navigation through the city street."
