  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet from the rain. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet from the rain, and the driver needs to maintain control of the vehicle. The frequent braking events are likely due to the rainy conditions, as the driver needs to slow down and stop more frequently to avoid accidents. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road, adjusting their speed and distance accordingly to ensure safe driving."
