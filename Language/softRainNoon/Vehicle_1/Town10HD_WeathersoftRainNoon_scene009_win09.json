  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A police car drives through a rainy city street with multiple other vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.6 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The police car is driving on a wide city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are driving at a moderate speed while others are parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible at the intersection, and they are displaying green and red lights. The weather is rainy, and the road is wet.",
  "reasoning": "The police car is driving at a moderate speed to ensure safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down when approaching the intersection to follow the traffic rules and to avoid any potential accidents. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and attentive to the changing traffic conditions."
