  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green. There are also some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is cloudy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The vehicle is braking frequently to maintain safety and avoid accidents. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The presence of other cars and pedestrians on the road requires the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive. The green traffic lights indicate that it is safe to proceed. Overall, the video shows a responsible and safe driving behavior in a challenging weather condition."
