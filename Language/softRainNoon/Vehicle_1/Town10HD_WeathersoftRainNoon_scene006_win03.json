  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, following a blue car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the street. The traffic is light, and there are no pedestrians visible. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is slightly reduced due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the blue car in front of it, and it adjusts its speed according to the wet road conditions. It is prepared to react to any potential hazards, such as pedestrians or other vehicles that may suddenly appear. The ego vehicle's sensors are constantly monitoring the traffic situation and the environment to ensure a safe driving experience."
