  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "An ambulance drives down a rainy city street with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The ambulance is driving straight ahead, and there is a blue and white bus parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle, an ambulance, is driving down the rainy city street at a moderate speed. It is following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions. The ambulance is likely responding to an emergency call, and its presence on the road may require other drivers to slow down or move over to make way."
