  "title": "Rainy city street driving with pedestrians and cars on the road.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a rainy city street with pedestrians and cars around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a slow-moving car on a rainy city street with pedestrians and cars around. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are moving faster than the ego vehicle. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and crossing the street at various points. The video captures the raindrops hitting the windshield and the sound of the wipers can be heard in the background. The road is lined with trees and buildings on both sides.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on the rainy city street to maintain safety and visibility. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. The braking events indicate that the driver is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as cars stopping or pedestrians crossing the street. The rainy weather conditions require the driver to be extra vigilant and adjust their driving accordingly to avoid accidents."
