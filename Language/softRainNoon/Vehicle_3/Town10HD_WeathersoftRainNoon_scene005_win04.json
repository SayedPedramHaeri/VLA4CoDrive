  "title": "Rainy city driving, slowing to stop at intersection.",
  "caption": "A green car is driving slowly in the rain, stopping at a red light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The traffic light is red, and the ego vehicle is stopping at the intersection. There is a tall building in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to maintain visibility and control. It slows down even more when approaching the intersection because it has to stop for the red light. The presence of parked cars on the side of the road suggests that there might be limited parking availability in this area. The tall building in the background adds to the urban environment of the scene."
