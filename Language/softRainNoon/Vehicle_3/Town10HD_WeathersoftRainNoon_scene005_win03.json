  "title": "Rainy city driving, slowing down for a red light.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 5.0 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic light turns red, and the red car slows down to stop. There is a tall building in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the need to be cautious. It slows down even more when approaching the red light, following the traffic rules to ensure safety. The tall building in the background adds to the urban environment of the city."
