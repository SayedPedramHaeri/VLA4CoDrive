  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with a white bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The white bus behind the red car is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously because of the rainy weather conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The presence of other vehicles on the road also requires the driver to be more attentive and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation. The white bus behind the red car is following at a safe distance, taking into account the reduced visibility and the potential for sudden braking or lane changes. The driver of the bus is likely adjusting their speed and following distance to ensure the safety of their passengers."
