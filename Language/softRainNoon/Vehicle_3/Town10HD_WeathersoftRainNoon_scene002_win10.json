  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 26 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events. There are other cars on the road, and a green car is parked on the side of the road. The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on either side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the sky is dark and cloudy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events because the weather conditions are challenging and the road is slippery. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid accidents. The multiple braking events indicate that the traffic is heavy, and the driver needs to be attentive to the road ahead. The green car parked on the side of the road may also be an obstacle that the driver needs to be aware of to avoid a collision."
