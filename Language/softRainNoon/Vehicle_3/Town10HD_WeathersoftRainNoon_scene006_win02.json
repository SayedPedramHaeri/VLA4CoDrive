  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street, slowing down and braking at two points.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed. The road is wet and there are several other cars and pedestrians around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green. The weather is cloudy and the visibility is slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes at two points, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safety. The rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians require the driver to be attentive and responsive to the changing conditions on the road."
