  "title": "Rainy city driving, slowing to stop at intersection",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the corner of the intersection. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The rainy weather reduces visibility and makes the road slippery, so the ego vehicle is driving cautiously. The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection, so it slows down to stop safely. It is important for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to be prepared for sudden braking or changes in traffic flow."
