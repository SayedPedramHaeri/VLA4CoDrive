  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with tall buildings and a large fountain.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large fountain in the middle of the roundabout. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is important for the driver to maintain a safe distance from the car in front and to be prepared for sudden braking events, as there have been 10 instances of strong deceleration in this window. The driver must also be aware of pedestrians and other obstacles, such as the large fountain in the middle of the roundabout."
