  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain, stopping at intersection with bus and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving with a red car driving down the street, stopping at an intersection with a bus and other cars. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. The traffic light is red and the pedestrian crossing is empty.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, stopping at the intersection because the traffic light is red. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the bus and other cars on the road. The wet road surface increases the stopping distance and requires extra attention to avoid accidents."
