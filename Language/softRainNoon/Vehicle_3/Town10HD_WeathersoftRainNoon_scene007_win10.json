  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars and pedestrians around. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a car in front of it. There is a traffic light at the intersection, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to maintain visibility and avoid any potential accidents. The driver is being cautious and following the car in front of it to maintain a safe distance. The presence of pedestrians and other vehicles on the road requires the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive to their surroundings."
