  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain, stopping at intersection with police car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city street with tall buildings, red car driving slowly and stopping at intersection. Other cars are also present, including a police car. The road is wet and visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping at the intersection because of the rainy weather, which reduces visibility and makes it harder to judge distances. The police car is also present at the intersection, which may contribute to the ego vehicle's cautious behavior."
