  "title": "Rainy city street driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street, passing a tall building and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The tall building in the background has many windows, and there is a large tree on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It keeps a safe distance from the parked truck and other cars on the road. The driver is attentive to the pedestrian crossing the street and the green traffic light, which signals that it is safe to continue driving."
