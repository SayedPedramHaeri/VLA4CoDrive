  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain, stopping at intersection, with police car and bus nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. The ego vehicle is a red car driving slowly and stopping at a red light. There is a police car and a bus nearby. The traffic is moderate and the visibility is low due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping at the red light because of the rainy weather conditions. The police car and the bus are nearby, but they are not the focus of the scene. The main concern is the rain and its impact on visibility and driving conditions."
