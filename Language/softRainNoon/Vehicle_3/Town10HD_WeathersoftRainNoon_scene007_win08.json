  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain on a busy city street, with multiple other vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a motorcycle driving in the same direction. The ego vehicle is a red car that is almost stopped at an intersection, waiting for the traffic light to change.",
  "reasoning": "The rainy weather reduces visibility and can make the road slippery, so the ego vehicle is driving cautiously and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The presence of pedestrians and the need to obey traffic signals are also important considerations for safe driving in this environment."
