  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A red car drives through an intersection in the rain, with a white and blue bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars and pedestrians around. The traffic light is red, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road. The bus is driving slowly behind the red car.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, maintaining a safe distance from the red car in front of it. It slows down and stops at the red traffic light, waiting for the signal to change. The bus behind it also drives slowly, following the speed limit and being extra cautious in the rainy conditions."
