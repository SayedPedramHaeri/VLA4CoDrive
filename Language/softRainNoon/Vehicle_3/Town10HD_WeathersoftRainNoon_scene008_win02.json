  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain, stopping at intersection with bus and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city street with red car driving slowly, stopping at intersection with a bus and other cars. The road is wet and visibility is low. Traffic lights are visible in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, stopping at the intersection to avoid potential accidents. The presence of other vehicles, including a bus, requires the driver to be cautious and maintain a safe distance. The wet road surface increases the braking distance, and the driver must be prepared for sudden braking or changes in traffic flow."
