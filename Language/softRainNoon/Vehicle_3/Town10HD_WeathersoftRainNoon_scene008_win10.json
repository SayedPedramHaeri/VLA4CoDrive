  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a rainy city street, almost stopped at an intersection with a large white bus nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a large white bus on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching the intersection and slows down to stop because the traffic light is red. The large white bus on the right side of the road is also stopping at the intersection, and the other cars on the street are maintaining a safe distance. The ego vehicle's braking system is engaged to bring it to a complete stop. The driver is paying close attention to the road and the surrounding traffic to ensure safe navigation through the intersection."
