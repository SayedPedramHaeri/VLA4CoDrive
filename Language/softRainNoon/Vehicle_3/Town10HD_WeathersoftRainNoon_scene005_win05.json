  "title": "Rainy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple parked cars and a crosswalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.2 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are multiple parked cars on the side of the road, and a crosswalk is visible in the distance. The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is slightly reduced. The traffic light is red, and there is a stop sign on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy weather conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the ego vehicle is likely reacting to other vehicles or pedestrians on the road. The presence of the crosswalk and the stop sign indicate that the ego vehicle needs to be cautious and prepared to stop if necessary."
