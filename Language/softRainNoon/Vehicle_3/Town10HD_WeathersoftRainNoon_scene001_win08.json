  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street, with a bus and other cars around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The traffic is light, with a few cars driving slowly. The bus is on the right side of the street, and there is a parked truck on the left side. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is approaching an intersection, and the driver needs to be cautious of pedestrians and other cars. The braking events suggest that the driver is being very careful and is prepared to stop if necessary."
