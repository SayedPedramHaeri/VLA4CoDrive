  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street, with a tall building in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the street. It is approaching an intersection, and the driver needs to be cautious and prepared to stop or turn. The tall building in the background suggests that the ego vehicle is in a downtown area, where the traffic can be more congested and unpredictable."
