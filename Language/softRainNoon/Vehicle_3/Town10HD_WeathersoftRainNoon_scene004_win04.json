  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, approaching an intersection. There are several other cars on the road, including a white van and a parked black car. The traffic lights are red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The road is wet and slippery due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly and cautiously in the rain, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. It slows down even more as it approaches the intersection, stopping at the red traffic light. The driver is being extra cautious due to the wet road conditions, which could lead to hydroplaning. The presence of the pedestrian crossing the street adds an additional safety consideration, requiring the driver to be extra vigilant."
