  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The traffic is light, with a few cars driving ahead of the ego vehicle. There is a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection, and a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of pedestrians at the intersection. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road, and it is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians to ensure safe navigation through the intersection."
