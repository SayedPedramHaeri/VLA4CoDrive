  "title": "Rainy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It slows down and changes lanes to avoid potential hazards, such as the parked truck on the side of the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the ego vehicle is constantly adjusting its speed and position to maintain safety. The large building on the right side of the road may indicate that the ego vehicle is approaching a commercial area, which could explain the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians."
