  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy day through a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving on a rainy day through a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and slippery, and the visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are several other vehicles on the road, including a blue car and a parked truck. The traffic light is visible in the distance, and it is showing a green light. The road is lined with buildings and trees on both sides, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet and slippery road. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and attentive to the traffic situation. The driver is also keeping a safe distance from other vehicles on the road to avoid any potential collisions. The presence of pedestrians and the green traffic light suggest that the driver is following the traffic rules and regulations."
