  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A green car drives slowly through a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The green car is driving slowly on a rainy day. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a white car. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The road is wet and the visibility is reduced due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The presence of multiple braking events suggests that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be extra cautious."
