  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving slowly on a rainy city street. The car is almost stopped at an intersection, with other cars and pedestrians visible in the surroundings. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs in the scene, some of which are red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to maintain visibility and avoid potential hazards. The car stops at the intersection to follow traffic rules and ensure the safety of pedestrians and other vehicles. The presence of multiple traffic lights and stop signs in the scene emphasizes the importance of adhering to traffic regulations in adverse weather conditions."
