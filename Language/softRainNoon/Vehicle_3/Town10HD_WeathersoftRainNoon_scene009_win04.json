  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain, stopping at intersection with white bus.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars. Red car driving slowly and stopping at intersection. White bus driving in the right lane. Pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. Traffic lights are visible in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping at the intersection because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The presence of the white bus and pedestrians on the sidewalk indicates that the driver needs to be extra careful while navigating through the intersection. The multiple braking events in this window suggest that the driver is applying brakes frequently to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
