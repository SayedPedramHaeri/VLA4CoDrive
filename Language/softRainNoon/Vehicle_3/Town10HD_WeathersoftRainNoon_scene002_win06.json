  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, braking twice in 11 seconds",
  "caption": "A green car drives through a rainy city street, braking twice in 11 seconds.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The green car is driving on a rainy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are driving at a moderate speed while others are parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible at the intersection, and they are showing red and green lights. The road is wet, and there are puddles of water on the ground.",
  "reasoning": "The green car is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It brakes twice in 11 seconds, first because a car in front of it suddenly brakes, and second because it approaches an intersection with a red traffic light. The car changes lanes to avoid a parked truck on the side of the road. The driver of the green car is cautious and drives carefully due to the rainy weather conditions."
