  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy day in a busy city, following a red car and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It follows a red car and changes lanes to avoid potential obstacles or pedestrians. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and adjusting the speed according to the traffic situation. The tall buildings and the busy street suggest that the ego vehicle is in a downtown area of the city."
