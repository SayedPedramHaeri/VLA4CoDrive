  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, approaching an intersection. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet from the rain. The weather is overcast, and visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly in the rain, approaching an intersection. It slows down further and stops, waiting for the traffic light to change. The driver is cautious due to the wet road conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The parked truck on the right side of the street may have obstructed the view of the traffic light, but the driver is attentive and patient, waiting for the light to turn green before proceeding."
