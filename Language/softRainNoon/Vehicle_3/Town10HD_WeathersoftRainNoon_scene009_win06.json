  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain, stopping at intersection, other cars and pedestrians nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city street with multiple lanes, parked cars on the side, and a traffic light. The red car is driving slowly and stopping at the intersection. There are other cars and pedestrians nearby, and the traffic light is red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, approaching an intersection. It slows down further and stops because the traffic light is red. The driver is cautious and maintains a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians, taking into account the wet road conditions and the potential for reduced visibility."
