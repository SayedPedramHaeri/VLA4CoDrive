  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The traffic is light, with a few cars driving ahead of the ego vehicle. There is a pedestrian crossing the street, and a traffic light is visible in the distance. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. It is approaching an intersection, and the driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents. The braking events indicate that the driver is using the vehicle's brakes to slow down and stop the car safely. The rainy weather conditions require the driver to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to be prepared for any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
