  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.2 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars and pedestrians around. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a red car in front of it. There is a traffic light at the intersection, and the cars are stopping to let pedestrians cross.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to maintain visibility and avoid any potential hazards. The driver is being cautious and following the red car in front to maintain a safe distance. The presence of pedestrians and the traffic light at the intersection require the driver to be extra vigilant and stop when necessary to ensure the safety of everyone on the road."
