  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a green car following closely behind.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.9 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large truck parked on the side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced. The green car follows the red car closely, and there are several other cars on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle, a green car, is following the red car at a close distance. The driver of the green car is likely trying to maintain a safe following distance, given the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic is heavy and that the driver of the green car needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid collisions."
