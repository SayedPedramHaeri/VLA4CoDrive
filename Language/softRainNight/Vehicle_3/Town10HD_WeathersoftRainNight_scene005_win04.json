  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and a red car parked on the right side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the braking events.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. It is adjusting its speed and lane position to maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead and avoid any potential accidents. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the ego vehicle is navigating through the city with extra care."
