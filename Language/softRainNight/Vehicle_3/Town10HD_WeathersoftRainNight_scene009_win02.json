  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street at night, with a bus and other cars around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The traffic is moderate, with a bus and other cars around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are sparse. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are frequent braking events.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The presence of the bus and other cars on the road adds to the complexity of the driving situation, requiring the ego vehicle to be extra vigilant and responsive."
