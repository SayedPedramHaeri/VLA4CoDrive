  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white van drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a blue bicycle crossing the intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars and trucks on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, with the driver paying close attention to the road and the surrounding traffic.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is likely driving cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead and is prepared to brake or change lanes as needed to avoid any potential accidents. The presence of the blue bicycle crossing the intersection highlights the need for the driver to be extra vigilant and aware of all road users, including pedestrians and cyclists."
