  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly down the rainy city street at night because of the wet road conditions and the presence of other cars. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the driver is constantly adjusting the speed to avoid collisions. The rainy weather also adds to the difficulty of driving and requires extra attention to be paid to the road ahead."
