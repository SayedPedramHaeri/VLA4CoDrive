  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.3 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green. The sidewalks are crowded with pedestrians and there are parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The weather conditions require the driver to be extra cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be attentive to avoid collisions. The driver is following the traffic rules and adjusting the speed according to the road conditions. The presence of pedestrians and parked cars on the side of the road requires the driver to be extra vigilant and cautious while driving."
