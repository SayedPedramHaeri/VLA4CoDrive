  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at night, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. A pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rain and low visibility. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the road ahead to ensure safe driving."
