  "title": "Rainy night city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, following a red truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is slightly reduced. The traffic is light, with only a few cars and trucks driving on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are sparse. The ego vehicle is driving straight, maintaining a safe distance from the red truck in front of it.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet from the rain, and the driver wants to maintain control of the vehicle. The driver is following the red truck in front of it, keeping a safe distance to avoid any potential accidents. The driver is also cautious of the pedestrians and other vehicles on the road, adjusting the speed and direction as needed to ensure a safe journey."
