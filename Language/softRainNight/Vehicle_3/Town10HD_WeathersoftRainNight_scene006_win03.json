  "title": "Rainy night city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with no significant braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is slightly reduced. There are several other cars on the road, all driving at moderate speeds. A few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalks. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all displaying green lights. The weather is rainy, and the rain is falling steadily.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet roads. It keeps a safe distance from the other cars on the road and adjusts its speed when approaching traffic lights. The driver is cautious and attentive, scanning the road for any potential hazards. The rainy weather conditions require extra attention to avoid accidents."
