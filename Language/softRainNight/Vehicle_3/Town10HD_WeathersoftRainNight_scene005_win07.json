  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city street with multiple parked cars and a stop sign.",
  "caption": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy night, approaching a stop sign.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the street. The traffic light is green, and there is a stop sign ahead. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently due to the rainy conditions.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously on the rainy night, maintaining a safe distance from the parked cars and other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying close attention to the road ahead, looking out for any potential hazards or obstacles. The stop sign ahead requires the driver to slow down and come to a complete stop before proceeding."
