  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the street. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions, and the multiple braking events suggest that there may be other vehicles or obstacles ahead. The driver is likely using the traffic lights and the presence of other cars to help guide their decisions. The tall building on the right side of the street may also be a landmark that the driver is using to help navigate the city."
