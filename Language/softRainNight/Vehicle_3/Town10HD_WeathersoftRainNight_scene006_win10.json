  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street at night. There are multiple cars parked on the side of the road. The road is wet from the rain. The traffic lights are visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night to ensure safety. The multiple braking events suggest that the road is slippery and the driver needs to be cautious. The parked cars on the side of the road may also require the driver to be extra careful to avoid any collisions."
