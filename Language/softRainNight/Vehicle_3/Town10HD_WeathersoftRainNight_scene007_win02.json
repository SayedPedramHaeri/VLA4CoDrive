  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple traffic lights and other vehicles.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several traffic lights and street lights illuminating the scene. The traffic is moderate, with other cars driving in the same direction and a few parked cars on the side of the road. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously, braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The rainy weather conditions make the road slippery and reduce visibility, so the ego vehicle is driving at a slower speed to ensure safety. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being extra cautious and is prepared to stop at any moment to avoid accidents. The presence of multiple traffic lights and street lights helps to guide the driver and maintain order on the road."
