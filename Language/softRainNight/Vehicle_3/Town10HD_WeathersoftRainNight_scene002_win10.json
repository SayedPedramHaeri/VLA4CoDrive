  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a busy city street with many other vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 26 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a blue car in front of it. There are many other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red. The pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk, and some of them are crossing the street at the crosswalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and wet road conditions, which require extra caution to avoid accidents. The blue car in front of the ego vehicle is also driving slowly, and the ego vehicle follows it to maintain a safe distance. The parked truck on the right side of the road is not obstructing the traffic flow, but it is important to be aware of its presence. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the ego vehicle is prepared to stop or slow down if needed. The pedestrians are also visible, and the ego vehicle is cautious not to hit them when crossing the street. Overall, the ego vehicle is driving carefully and defensively to ensure the safety of all road users."
