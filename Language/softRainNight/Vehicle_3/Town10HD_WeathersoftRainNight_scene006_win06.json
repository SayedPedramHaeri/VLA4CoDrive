  "title": "Rainy night city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with no significant braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is dark and rainy, with visibility slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It keeps a safe distance from the other cars and slows down when approaching the traffic lights. The driver is cautious and attentive to the pedestrian crossing the street, taking into account the reduced visibility due to the rain."
