  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street at night, with a bus and other cars around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently. There are other cars on the road, including a bus and a parked truck. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the street is illuminated by streetlights and the headlights of the other cars.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents and to maintain a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The presence of the bus and the parked truck may also require the ego vehicle to adjust its speed and trajectory to navigate the road safely."
