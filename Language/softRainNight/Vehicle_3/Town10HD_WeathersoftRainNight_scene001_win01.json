  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a rainy city street at night, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a white van in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all red. The sidewalks are lit up with streetlights, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalks.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rain and low visibility. It is following the white van in front of it at a safe distance, and it brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the ego vehicle slows down when approaching an intersection. The pedestrians on the sidewalks are also visible, and the ego vehicle is careful not to hit them. Overall, the ego vehicle is prioritizing safety and driving defensively in these challenging conditions."
