  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives behind a bus on a rainy night in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently. There are several other cars on the road, and a bus is driving ahead of the red car. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The red car is following the bus ahead of it, maintaining a safe distance. The traffic lights in the distance are showing green, indicating that the red car can continue driving straight."
