  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.5 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The rain creates a misty atmosphere, and the streetlights provide illumination for the vehicles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain control on the wet road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic ahead is stopping frequently, possibly due to the rainy conditions. The ego vehicle must remain vigilant and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead to avoid collisions."
