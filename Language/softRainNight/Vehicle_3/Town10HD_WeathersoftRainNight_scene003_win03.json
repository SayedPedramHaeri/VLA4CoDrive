  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, with the driver paying close attention to the road and the other vehicles.",
  "reasoning": "The rainy weather and the presence of multiple braking events suggest that the driver is exercising extra caution to avoid accidents. The slow speed of the ego vehicle indicates that the driver is prioritizing safety over speed, which is a responsible decision in these conditions. The presence of other vehicles and the need to pay attention to traffic lights and pedestrians also require the driver to stay focused and alert."
