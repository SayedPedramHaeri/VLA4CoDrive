  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street at night, with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The bus behind the red car is white and blue, and it is driving slowly. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other cars on the road. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions and to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The bus behind it is also driving slowly, possibly due to the same weather conditions. The red car is being cautious and following the bus at a safe distance, taking into account the reduced visibility and the potential for sudden braking or lane changes from other drivers."
