  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a rainy city street at night, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a rainy city street at night. It is almost stopped and braking frequently. There are other cars on the road, and the traffic lights are visible in the distance. The road is wet and reflecting the city lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously on the rainy city street at night. It is braking frequently to avoid any potential accidents. The wet road surface and the reduced visibility due to the rain make it necessary to drive at a slower speed and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the ego vehicle is following the traffic rules by stopping at the red lights and proceeding when the lights turn green."
