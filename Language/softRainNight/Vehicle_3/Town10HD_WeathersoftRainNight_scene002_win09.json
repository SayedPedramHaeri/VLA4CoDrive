  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and 12 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.1 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently green. The road is wet from the rain and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy and visibility is slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night in a city. It is braking frequently, likely due to the wet road conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the cars ahead and is prepared to stop or slow down further if necessary. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and the ego vehicle is following the rules of the road. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are not posing any immediate danger, but the ego vehicle is still cautious and alert while driving."
