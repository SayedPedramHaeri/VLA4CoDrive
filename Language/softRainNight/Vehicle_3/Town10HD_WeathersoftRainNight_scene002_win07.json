  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A black car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a red car in the distance and a green traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are tall buildings on either side of the street. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road, and it brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The red car in the distance is also driving at a moderate speed, and the green traffic light indicates that it is safe to continue driving. The tall buildings on either side of the street provide some shelter from the rain, but the visibility is still somewhat reduced. The ego vehicle must remain vigilant and cautious to ensure safe driving in these conditions."
