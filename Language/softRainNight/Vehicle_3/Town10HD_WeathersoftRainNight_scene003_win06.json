  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green. The sidewalks are lit up with street lamps and there are palm trees along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night in a city. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions. The driver is also following the traffic rules and adjusting the speed according to the traffic flow. The presence of other cars on the road and the green traffic lights indicate that the driver is aware of the traffic situation and is making safe driving decisions."
