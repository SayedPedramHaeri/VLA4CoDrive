  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a rainy city street at night, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a rainy city street at night. It is almost stopped and braking frequently. There are other cars on the road, including a blue car and a parked white car. The road is wet and there are street lights and traffic lights visible. The weather is rainy and visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving cautiously on the rainy city street at night. It brakes frequently to avoid potential risks and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The parked white car obstructs one lane, forcing the red car to change lanes. The blue car is also driving carefully on the wet road. The traffic lights and street lights provide some illumination in the dark night."
