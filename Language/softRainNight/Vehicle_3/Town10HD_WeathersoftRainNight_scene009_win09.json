  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a white bus following behind.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The pedestrians are sparse, and most of them are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The white bus following behind is maintaining a safe distance, and the pedestrians on the sidewalk are not posing any immediate danger. The ego vehicle is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary, and it is constantly monitoring the traffic situation ahead to ensure a safe journey."
