  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a stop sign on the right side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The red car slows down and stops at several points along the street, possibly due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions, which can reduce visibility and make the road slippery. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being extra careful, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles or pedestrians on the street. The stop sign on the right side of the road also requires the driver to slow down and stop before proceeding."
