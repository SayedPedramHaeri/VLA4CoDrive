  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red sports car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.2 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, with its headlights on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other cars on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and that the ego vehicle is trying to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The large building on the right side of the road may be a landmark or a destination for the ego vehicle's driver."
