  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street at night, following a bus.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is a red car driving slowly behind a bus. There are other cars on the road, and some parked on the side. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions. It is following the bus ahead, and it brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver needs to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front to prevent accidents."
