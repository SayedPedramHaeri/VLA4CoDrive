  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is dark and rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents. The driver is cautious and attentive to the surroundings, including the pedestrian and the traffic lights. The rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road require the driver to be extra vigilant and to adjust the speed and braking accordingly."
