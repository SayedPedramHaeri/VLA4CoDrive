  "title": "Rainy night city driving with a red car and a bus on the road.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with a red car and a bus on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.9 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The traffic is light, and the vehicles are moving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green and red lights. The pedestrians are also visible on the sidewalk, and they are walking slowly. The ego vehicle is following a car in front of it, and it is changing lanes to overtake a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night to ensure safety and avoid any potential accidents. It is following the car in front of it and changing lanes to overtake the parked truck on the side of the road. The driver is being cautious and attentive to the traffic lights and pedestrians on the sidewalk. The rain is reducing visibility, and the driver is using the vehicle sensors to detect any potential risks or obstacles on the road."
