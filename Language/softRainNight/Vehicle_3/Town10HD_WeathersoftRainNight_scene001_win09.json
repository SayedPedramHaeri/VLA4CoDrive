  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "Red sports car driving on a rainy city street at night, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red sports car is driving on a rainy city street at night. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying green and red lights. The street is illuminated by the streetlights and the headlights of the cars. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The red sports car is driving at a very slow speed and braking frequently due to the rainy conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The frequent braking is likely due to the slippery road surface caused by the rain. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and adjusting their speed accordingly."
