  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street at night, with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and slippery. The traffic is light, with only a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The bus behind the red car is also driving slowly, following at a safe distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The presence of the bus behind the red car suggests that the traffic is moving slowly overall, possibly due to the weather conditions."
