  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a green traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving around. The traffic light is green, and the pedestrian crossing is empty. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, and there are several other cars on the road. The green traffic light indicates that it is safe to proceed, but the driver must remain cautious of other vehicles and pedestrians. The rain and low visibility require the driver to maintain a safe distance from other cars and to be prepared for sudden braking or other unexpected events."
