  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing.",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street at night, with a bus and other cars on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The traffic is light, with a few cars driving in the same direction as the red car. There is a pedestrian crossing the street at a crosswalk, and the traffic lights are showing green for the red car.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the rain and the pedestrian crossing the street. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules, maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The bus and other cars are also driving carefully, adjusting their speed to the rainy conditions. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and following their signals to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
