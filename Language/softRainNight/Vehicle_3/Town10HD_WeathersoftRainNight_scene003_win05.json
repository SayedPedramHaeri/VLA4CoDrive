  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid collisions.",
  "reasoning": "The rainy weather conditions make the road slippery, and the ego vehicle is driving cautiously to ensure safety. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful, possibly due to the reduced visibility and traction. The presence of other cars and pedestrians on the street also requires the driver to be attentive and responsive to avoid accidents."
