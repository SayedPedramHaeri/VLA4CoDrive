  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing.",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly on a rainy city street at night, with a pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.2 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving slowly on a rainy city street at night. There is a pedestrian crossing the street. The road is wet and visibility is low due to the rain. The traffic is light and there are no major obstacles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the street. The braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is applying the brakes frequently to maintain a safe speed and distance from other vehicles on the road."
