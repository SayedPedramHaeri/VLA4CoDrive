  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are sparse. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the braking events.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of multiple braking events. It is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and adjusting its speed to avoid sudden braking. The tall buildings and palm trees create a visually appealing cityscape at night."
