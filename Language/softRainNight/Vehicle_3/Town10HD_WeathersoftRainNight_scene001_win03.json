  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is dark and gloomy, with the headlights of the ego vehicle illuminating the road ahead.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the street. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the road conditions to ensure a smooth and safe journey."
