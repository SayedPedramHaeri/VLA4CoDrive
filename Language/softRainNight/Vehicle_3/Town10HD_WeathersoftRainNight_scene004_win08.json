  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.9 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, with the driver paying close attention to the road and the surrounding traffic.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, which can make it harder to see and react to obstacles or other vehicles. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The presence of the large building on the right side of the road may also be influencing the driver's decision-making, as they need to be aware of potential turns or exits. Overall, the ego vehicle is prioritizing safety and careful driving in these challenging conditions."
