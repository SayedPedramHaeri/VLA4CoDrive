  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are green.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious due to the wet road and reduced visibility. The multiple braking events suggest that there are other vehicles on the road that are also slowing down. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of them and is prepared to brake if necessary. The green traffic lights in the distance indicate that it is safe to continue driving."
