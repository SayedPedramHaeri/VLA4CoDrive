  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white bus drives down a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down a rainy city street at night. There are many other vehicles on the road, including a white bus and a parked truck. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red. The road is wet and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and wet road conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be attentive to avoid collisions. The white bus and parked truck are also driving slowly, indicating that everyone is being careful on this rainy night."
