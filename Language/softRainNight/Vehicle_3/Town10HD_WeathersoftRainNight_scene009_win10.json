  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a car driving slowly on a rainy city street. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing red and green lights. The video also shows a tall building on the right side of the road and a parked truck on the left side. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the drivers are being cautious. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles in front of it and is prepared to brake or change lanes as needed. The tall building and parked truck on the side of the road are not posing any immediate danger but they add to the overall urban environment of the scene."
