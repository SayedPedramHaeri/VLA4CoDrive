  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying green and red lights. The sidewalks are illuminated by streetlights and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night, which requires extra caution and attention to avoid accidents. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is heavy and the drivers need to be extra vigilant. The rainy weather conditions also require the drivers to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to be prepared for sudden braking or changes in direction. The ego vehicle is following the traffic rules and regulations and is trying to maintain a safe speed and distance from other vehicles on the road."
