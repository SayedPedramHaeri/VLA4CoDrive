  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are sparse. The rain creates a misty atmosphere, and the headlights of the cars illuminate the road ahead.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other cars on the road. The driver must be cautious and attentive to the changing traffic situations and pedestrians who may be less visible in the rain."
