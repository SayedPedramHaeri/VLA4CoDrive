  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with palm trees and traffic lights.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city with palm trees and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other cars on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The red car in front of the ego vehicle is also driving slowly, and the ego vehicle is following it at a safe distance. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk, making sure to obey all traffic rules and regulations."
