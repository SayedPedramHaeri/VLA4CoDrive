  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red sports car drives slowly on a rainy city street at night, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, with its headlights on. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street, and the streetlights are on. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are moving back and forth.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rainy and dark conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic situation and adjusting the speed and braking accordingly. The safety considerations include maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles, being prepared for sudden braking or changes in direction, and ensuring good visibility of the road ahead."
