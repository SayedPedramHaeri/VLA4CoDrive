  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green. The sidewalks are illuminated by streetlights and there are some parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night in a city. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions. The driver is also following the traffic rules by stopping at the traffic lights. The presence of other cars on the road and the need to maintain a safe distance from them requires the driver to be attentive and responsive to the traffic situation. The driver is also being considerate of the pedestrians who might be crossing the road in such poor visibility conditions."
