  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly down a rainy city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street, and the road is wet from the rain. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly down the rainy city street at night to ensure safety. The frequent braking events suggest that the other cars on the road are also trying to navigate the wet and slippery road conditions. The driver of the blue car needs to be extra cautious and maintain a safe distance from the other vehicles to avoid any accidents. The tall buildings on both sides of the street create a canyon-like effect, which can make it difficult to see upcoming traffic signals or pedestrians. Therefore, the driver needs to be extra vigilant and rely on their sensors and driving algorithms to make safe driving decisions."
