  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a bus and other cars on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with a bus and other cars visible. The streetlights are on, and the traffic lights are visible at intersections. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes when approaching intersections or other vehicles, and it keeps a safe distance from the bus and other cars on the road. The rain and wet road surface require extra caution to avoid accidents or skidding."
