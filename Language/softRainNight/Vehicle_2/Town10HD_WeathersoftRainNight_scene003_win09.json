  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car driving slowly in a city at night, with rain on the streets.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are green. There are also some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. The driver is being cautious and braking frequently to avoid any accidents. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful in these conditions. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk to ensure safe navigation through the city."
