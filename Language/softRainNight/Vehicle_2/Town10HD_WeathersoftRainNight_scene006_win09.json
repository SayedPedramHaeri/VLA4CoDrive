  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with many parked cars and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is moderate. The traffic is light, with only a few cars driving on the opposite side of the road. The traffic lights are mostly green, but there are a few red lights at the intersections. The parked cars are mostly on the side of the road, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously because of the rain and the potential for slippery roads. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the other vehicles on the road, and is prepared to brake or change lanes as needed. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is being very cautious and is taking a defensive driving approach to ensure safety."
