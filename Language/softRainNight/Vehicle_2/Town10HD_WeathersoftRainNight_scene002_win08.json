  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are green. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street and some of them are lit up. The streetlights are on and they are casting a yellow glow on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night in a city. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions. The driver is also following the traffic rules and adjusting the speed according to the traffic flow. The presence of other cars on the road indicates that the driver is aware of the surrounding traffic and is maintaining a safe distance from them. The tall buildings and the lit-up signs suggest that the driver is in an urban area with commercial establishments. The driver is likely to be navigating through the city streets, making occasional stops and turns as required by the traffic rules and the road conditions."
