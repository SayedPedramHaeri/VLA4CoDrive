  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue and white car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.1 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the braking cars.",
  "reasoning": "The rainy weather and the presence of multiple braking events suggest that the driver needs to be extra cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk indicate that this is a city street, and the driver should be prepared for sudden turns or pedestrians crossing the street. The ego vehicle's slow speed and lane changes demonstrate the driver's defensive driving strategy to avoid potential accidents."
