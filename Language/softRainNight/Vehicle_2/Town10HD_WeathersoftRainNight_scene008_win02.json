  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing",
  "caption": "A small car drives on a rainy night in a city, with a bus and other cars on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides. The traffic is light, with a few cars driving at moderate speeds. The bus is blue and white and is driving on the opposite side of the road. There is a pedestrian crossing the street in front of the bus.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the pedestrian crossing the street. The bus is following the speed limit and is driving on the opposite side of the road. The other cars on the road are also driving at moderate speeds, and the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from them. The rain reduces visibility, and the ego vehicle needs to be extra cautious to avoid any accidents."
