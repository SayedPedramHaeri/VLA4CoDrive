  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing.",
  "caption": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night in a city with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There is a pedestrian crossing the street in front of the ego vehicle. The road is wet and visibility is low due to the rain. There are other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the background and they are red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the street. The driver is also keeping a safe distance from the other cars on the road to avoid any accidents. The rain is making the road slippery and reducing visibility, so the driver needs to be extra careful while driving."
