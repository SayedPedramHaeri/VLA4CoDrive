  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city, with many other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is moderate. The traffic is moderate, with many other cars and pedestrians around. There are several traffic lights and stop signs visible, and the ego vehicle is almost stopped, braking frequently. The road layout is a typical city street with multiple lanes and intersections.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully due to the rainy and dark conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and stop signs to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
