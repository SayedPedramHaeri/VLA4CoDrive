  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are tall buildings and street lights on both sides of the street. The traffic light ahead is red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events are likely due to the rainy conditions and the need to slow down or stop for other cars or pedestrians. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic light ahead, which is currently red, and will likely slow down or stop when it turns green."
