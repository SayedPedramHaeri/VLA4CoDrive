  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a busy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a busy city street with multiple traffic lights and other vehicles. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. The traffic lights are mostly red and green, and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the streets are slick.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. The multiple braking events are likely due to the reduced visibility and the need to react to other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians, and is prepared to stop or change lanes as needed. The rainy weather requires extra caution and attention to the road and traffic conditions."
