  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a stop sign on the right side of the road. The pedestrians are sparse, and most of them are under the shelter of the buildings. The rain creates a misty atmosphere, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the potential for slippery roads. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The blue car maintains a safe distance from the cars in front of it and adjusts its speed according to the traffic flow. The stop sign and traffic lights are important cues for the ego vehicle to follow the traffic rules and ensure safety."
