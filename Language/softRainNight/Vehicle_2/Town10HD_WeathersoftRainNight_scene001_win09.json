  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a bus and other cars around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The blue car is driving slowly, and there are other cars on the road, including a bus. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are some parked cars on the side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the headlights of the cars are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, and it frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The blue car is maintaining a safe distance from the bus and other cars on the road, and it is carefully navigating the wet road. The driver of the blue car is being cautious and attentive to the traffic situation, and the vehicle's sensors are constantly monitoring the surroundings to ensure safety."
