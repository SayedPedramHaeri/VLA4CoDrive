  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A person is driving a vehicle in a city at night in the rain.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.3 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and braking frequently.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. The frequent braking is likely due to the rainy conditions and the need to react to other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles to avoid any accidents."
