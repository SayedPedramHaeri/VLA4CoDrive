  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue and white car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other cars on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is frequently applying the brakes to slow down or stop the car. The rainy weather conditions and the presence of pedestrians on the sidewalk require the driver to be extra vigilant and cautious while driving."
