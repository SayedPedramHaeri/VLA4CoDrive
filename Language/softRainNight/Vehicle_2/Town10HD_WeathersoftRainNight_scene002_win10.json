  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a black car parked on the right side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a crosswalk near the parked black car. The visibility is moderate, and the weather is rainy.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other cars on the street. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the parked black car. The rainy weather and the presence of pedestrians near the crosswalk require the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive to the surroundings."
