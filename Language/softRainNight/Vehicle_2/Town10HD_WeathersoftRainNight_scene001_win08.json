  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a bus and other cars around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The blue car is driving slowly, and there are other cars on the road, including a bus. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The rain is falling heavily, and the headlights of the cars are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, which reduce visibility and make it harder to see other vehicles and pedestrians. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the driver needs to be cautious to avoid collisions. The blue car is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles, and the driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
