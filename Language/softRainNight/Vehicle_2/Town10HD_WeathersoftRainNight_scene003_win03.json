  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the braking events.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of multiple braking events. It is changing lanes to avoid getting too close to the vehicles in front of it. The pedestrian crossing the street is also a safety consideration for the ego vehicle. Overall, the ego vehicle is prioritizing safety and adapting its driving behavior to the current conditions."
