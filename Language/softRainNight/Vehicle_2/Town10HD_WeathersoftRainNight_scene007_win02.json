  "title": "Rainy night city driving with ambulance and police car",
  "caption": "A slow-moving ambulance drives down a rainy city street at night, with other cars and a police car nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.7 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ambulance is driving slowly, and other cars are following at a safe distance. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road. The police car is parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, and there is an ambulance and a police car nearby. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road, and it is paying close attention to the traffic lights and street signs to ensure safe navigation. The rainy weather and the presence of emergency vehicles require extra caution and careful driving."
