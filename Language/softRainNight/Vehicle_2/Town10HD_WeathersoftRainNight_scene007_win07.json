  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrians on sidewalk.",
  "caption": "A blue and white car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with pedestrians on the sidewalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a white car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and a few traffic lights and street signs. The weather is rainy, and the rain is falling heavily.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and foggy conditions, which reduce visibility and make it harder to see other vehicles and pedestrians. The driver is being cautious and following the white car in front of it to maintain a safe distance. The presence of pedestrians on the sidewalk suggests that the driver needs to be extra careful and watch out for them, especially when turning or changing lanes. The rainy weather also means that the road is slippery, so the driver needs to be careful not to lose control of the vehicle. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and being extra cautious in these challenging conditions."
