  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a busy city street with many other vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is moderate. The traffic is moderate, with many other vehicles and pedestrians around. There are several traffic lights and stop signs visible along the road. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions and the presence of many other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. It is braking frequently to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to avoid any potential accidents. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and stop signs to ensure that they follow all traffic rules and regulations."
