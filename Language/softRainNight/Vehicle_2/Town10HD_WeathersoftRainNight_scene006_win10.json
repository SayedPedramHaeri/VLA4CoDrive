  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with multiple braking events. There are other cars on the road, and the traffic lights are visible in the distance. The road is wet, and the visibility is low due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly to maintain safety on the rainy night. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the drivers are being cautious. The rainy weather conditions make it difficult to see the road clearly, and the drivers need to be extra careful to avoid accidents. The blue car is following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
