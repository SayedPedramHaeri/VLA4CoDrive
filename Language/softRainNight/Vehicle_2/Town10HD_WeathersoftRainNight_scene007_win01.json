  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is following a blue car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, and some of them are also driving slowly. There are traffic lights at the intersection ahead, and the ego vehicle is approaching them. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being extra careful due to the reduced visibility and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front of it, and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The driver is also paying close attention to the traffic lights at the intersection ahead, and is ready to slow down or stop if required by the traffic signals."
