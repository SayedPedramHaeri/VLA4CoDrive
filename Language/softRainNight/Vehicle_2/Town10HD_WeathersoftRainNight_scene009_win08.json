  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are several other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road is wet, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is braking frequently, possibly due to the wet road surface and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead to avoid any potential accidents. The pedestrians on the sidewalk and the parked truck on the right side of the street are also important factors to consider while driving in this environment."
