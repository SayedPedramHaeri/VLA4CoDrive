  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a busy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, trying to avoid any potential accidents due to the slippery road conditions.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rainy weather, which can make the road slippery and more difficult to control. The multiple braking events suggest that the other vehicles on the street are also trying to navigate the challenging conditions carefully. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and adjusting its speed according to the traffic flow. It is important for the driver to stay alert and focused in such conditions to ensure the safety of all road users."
