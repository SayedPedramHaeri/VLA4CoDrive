  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a city intersection with multiple traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.8 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly through a busy city intersection with multiple traffic lights. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking or stopping. The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is slightly reduced. The traffic lights are mostly green, but there are a few red lights that the blue car passes through.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the intersection because of the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules, braking or stopping when necessary. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is being extra careful, possibly due to the slippery road surface. Overall, this is a safe and responsible driving behavior in the given weather conditions."
