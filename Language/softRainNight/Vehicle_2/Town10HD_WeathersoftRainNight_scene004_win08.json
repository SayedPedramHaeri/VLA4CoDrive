  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are green. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street and the streetlights are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet and visibility is reduced. The frequent braking is likely due to the presence of other cars on the road. The ego vehicle is following the traffic rules and trying to maintain a safe distance from the other vehicles. The rainy weather and the presence of tall buildings and streetlights create a challenging environment for driving, but the ego vehicle is equipped with sensors and technology to handle these conditions safely."
