  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white and blue bus drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.4 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the street. The bus is driving in the right lane, and there is a blue car parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a crosswalk near the bus. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The bus is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the driver needs to be attentive to avoid collisions. The bus is approaching a crosswalk, so the driver needs to be prepared to stop if necessary."
