  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees. There are multiple braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. The traffic situation seems moderate with other vehicles and pedestrians visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees. The driver is likely being cautious due to the wet road and reduced visibility. The multiple braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is reacting to changes in the traffic situation or obstacles on the road. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians, and is prepared to stop or change lanes as needed."
