  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees. There are multiple braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. The traffic seems to be light and there are no pedestrians or other obstacles visible.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees. The driver is likely being cautious due to the wet road and reduced visibility. The multiple braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is reacting to changes in the traffic situation or trying to avoid potential hazards. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the front car and is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary."
