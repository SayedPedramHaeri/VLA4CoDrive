  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.1 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving in the right lane.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy conditions, and it frequently brakes to avoid potential risks. The presence of other cars on the street requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for sudden braking or changes in direction. The tall building on the right side of the road is an important landmark that helps the ego vehicle navigate the city streets. The traffic lights in the distance are visible, but they are not the main focus of the ego vehicle's attention at this moment."
