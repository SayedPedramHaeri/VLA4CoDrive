  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A black car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a blue car in front and a black truck to the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a crosswalk near the blue car. The ego vehicle is driving carefully due to the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the blue car in front, and slows down when approaching the crosswalk. It also brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The rain reduces visibility and requires the driver to be extra cautious while driving."
