  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a rainy city street at night, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a rainy city street at night. It is almost stopped and braking frequently. There are other cars on the road, including a red car parked on the side of the road. The road is wet and visibility is low due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly and braking frequently due to the rainy conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The red car parked on the side of the road may indicate that there is a destination or point of interest nearby. The traffic lights and street signs provide guidance and information for navigating the city streets at night."
