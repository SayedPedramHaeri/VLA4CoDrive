  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrians on sidewalk.",
  "caption": "A rainy night in a city with the ego vehicle almost stopped, pedestrians on the sidewalk, and other cars driving.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night in a city with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are pedestrians on the sidewalk and other cars driving. The road is wet and visibility is low. The traffic light is red and there is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching an intersection with a red traffic light, so it slows down to stop. There are pedestrians on the sidewalk, so the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance to avoid any accidents. The parked truck on the side of the road could be an obstacle for other vehicles, so the ego vehicle needs to be cautious while driving."
