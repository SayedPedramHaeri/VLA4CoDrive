  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a city intersection with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly through a city intersection with multiple braking events. The road is wet from rain and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying green lights. The sidewalks are also visible on either side of the road and there are several pedestrians walking on them.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the city intersection because of the rainy weather conditions and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The pedestrians on the sidewalks are also visible and the driver is being mindful of their presence. The traffic lights are displaying green lights, indicating that it is safe to proceed. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging weather conditions."
