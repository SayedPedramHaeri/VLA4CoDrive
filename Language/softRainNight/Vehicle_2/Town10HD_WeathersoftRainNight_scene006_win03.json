  "title": "Rainy night city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "A red truck drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a bus stop and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is slightly reduced. The traffic is light, with only a few cars and trucks driving on the street. The red truck passes a bus stop and a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It keeps a safe distance from the parked truck on the right side of the road. The driver is alert and cautious, paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The rainy weather conditions require extra attention to avoid any potential accidents."
