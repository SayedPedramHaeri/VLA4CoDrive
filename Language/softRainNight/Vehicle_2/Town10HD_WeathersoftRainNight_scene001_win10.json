  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a rainy night in a city, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a rainy night in a city. It is almost stopped and brakes frequently. There are other cars on the road, including a red car and a white car. The road is wet from the rain. There are tall buildings and street lights along the road. The traffic light is red.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The wet road surface reduces traction and increases braking distance, so the driver must be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The red traffic light indicates that the blue car must stop at the intersection."
