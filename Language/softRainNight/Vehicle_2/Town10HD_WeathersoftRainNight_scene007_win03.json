  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with palm trees and other cars.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously on a rainy night, following a blue car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, including a blue car that the ego vehicle is following. There are also palm trees lining the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is dark and rainy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front, and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The presence of palm trees suggests that the location is in a warmer climate, possibly in the southern United States or in a country near the equator."
