  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.7 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with multiple other cars and pedestrians. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road. The weather is rainy and the sky is dark.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as pedestrians crossing the road or other vehicles stopping abruptly. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and street signs to ensure that they are following the rules of the road."
