  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and parked cars on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently, possibly due to the rainy conditions.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously on the rainy city street, braking frequently to avoid potential accidents. The driver is likely being extra careful due to the wet road conditions, which can be slippery and reduce visibility. The presence of tall buildings and parked cars on the side of the road also requires the driver to be attentive to potential obstacles or pedestrians crossing the street."
