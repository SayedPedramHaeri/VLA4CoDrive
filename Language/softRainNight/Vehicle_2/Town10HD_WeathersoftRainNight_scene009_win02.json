  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street. There is a pedestrian crossing the street. The road is wet and visibility is low. The traffic is light and there are no obstacles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The pedestrian crossing the street is another safety consideration that the driver is paying attention to. The driver is also following the traffic rules and regulations, and adjusting the speed according to the road conditions."
