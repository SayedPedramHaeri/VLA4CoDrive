  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a bus and a truck in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The blue car is driving slowly, and there are other vehicles on the road, including a bus and a truck. The traffic lights are visible in the background, and they are showing red and green lights. The rain is falling heavily, and the headlights of the vehicles are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, and it is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The blue car is maintaining a safe distance from the bus and the truck in front of it, and it is carefully navigating the wet road. The driver of the blue car is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the movements of other vehicles to ensure safe driving in these challenging conditions."
