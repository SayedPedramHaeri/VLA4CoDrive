  "caption": "A grey car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The grey car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with tall buildings. The road is wet and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying green and red lights. The weather is rainy and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The grey car is driving slowly and braking frequently because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is anticipating potential risks and is prepared to stop or slow down if necessary."
