  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly in a busy city intersection at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night in a busy city intersection. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, stopping at the intersection. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also stopping at the intersection. The traffic lights are visible in the background and they are red. The street is wet and there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rainy night to ensure safety. It stops at the intersection because the traffic lights are red. The other cars on the road are also stopping at the intersection, following the traffic rules. The wet street and the pedestrians on the sidewalk are potential risks, so the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from them. The rainy weather and the busy city intersection require the driver to be extra cautious and attentive."
