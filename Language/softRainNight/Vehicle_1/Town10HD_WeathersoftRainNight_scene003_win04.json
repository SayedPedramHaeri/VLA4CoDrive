  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying green and red lights. The sidewalks are illuminated by streetlights and there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalks.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night in a city. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and attentive to the traffic situation. The wet road surface and reduced visibility require the driver to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to be prepared for sudden braking or other unexpected events. The driver is also following the traffic rules and obeying the traffic lights. Overall, the driver is demonstrating responsible and safe driving behavior in challenging conditions."
