  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly in a busy city intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night in a busy city intersection. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, with other cars and pedestrians visible around it. The traffic lights are red, and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, with an average speed of 0.0 m/s, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rainy night city intersection because it is approaching a red traffic light and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. The rainy weather conditions and the presence of multiple cars and pedestrians in the intersection require the driver to be attentive and prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The ego vehicle's main action is to navigate the intersection safely and efficiently, taking into account the current traffic situation and the weather conditions."
