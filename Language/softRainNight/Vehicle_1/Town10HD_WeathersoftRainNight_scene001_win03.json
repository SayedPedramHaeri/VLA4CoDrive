  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a bus and a truck nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars and a bus on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are some parked cars on the side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents with other vehicles or pedestrians. The presence of the bus and the truck nearby suggests that the traffic is moderate, and the ego vehicle needs to be extra cautious while driving. The parked cars on the side of the road also require the ego vehicle to be aware of its surroundings and adjust its driving accordingly."
