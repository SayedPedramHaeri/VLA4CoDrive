  "caption": "A white van drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars and a bus driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are mostly green, but there is a red light at one intersection. The pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk, and there is a large truck parked on the side of the road.",
