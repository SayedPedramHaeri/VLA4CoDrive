  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street at night, with a bus and other cars on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The white car is driving slowly, following a red car. There is a bus on the right side of the road, and a parked truck on the left. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions, and the multiple braking events suggest that the traffic ahead is stopping frequently. The driver must maintain a safe distance from the car in front and be prepared to brake or change lanes as needed."
