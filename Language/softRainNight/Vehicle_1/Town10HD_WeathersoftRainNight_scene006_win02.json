  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with no significant braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large billboard on the side of the road. The weather is dark and rainy, with visibility slightly reduced. The ego vehicle is driving in the right lane, and there is a large truck parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It is keeping a safe distance from the other cars on the road and adjusting its speed according to the traffic flow. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the billboard on the side of the road to anticipate any changes in the driving conditions."
