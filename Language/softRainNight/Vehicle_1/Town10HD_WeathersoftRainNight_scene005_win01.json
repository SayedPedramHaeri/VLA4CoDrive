  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a tall building in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.9 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is dark and rainy, with the headlights on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes when approaching intersections or pedestrian crossings. The tall building in the background adds to the urban atmosphere of the scene."
