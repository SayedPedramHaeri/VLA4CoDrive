  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently, likely due to the rainy conditions.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously on the rainy city street to avoid any potential accidents. The frequent braking events are likely due to the reduced visibility and slippery road surface caused by the rain. The driver is being extra cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
