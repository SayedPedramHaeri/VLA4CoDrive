  "title": "Rainy night city driving with pedestrian crossing",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a rainy night in a city street with a pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a car driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street. There is a pedestrian crossing in the distance. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. The traffic lights are visible and they are displaying green and yellow lights. There are other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The pedestrian crossing in the distance is an important safety consideration for the driver. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and following the rules of the road. The presence of other cars on the road requires the driver to be vigilant and prepared for any sudden movements or obstacles."
