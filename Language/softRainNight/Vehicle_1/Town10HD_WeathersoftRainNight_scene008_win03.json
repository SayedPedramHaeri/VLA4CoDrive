  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a busy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the braking cars.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of multiple braking events. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and adjusting its speed and direction to avoid any potential accidents. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk, ensuring that they follow all the traffic rules and prioritize safety."
