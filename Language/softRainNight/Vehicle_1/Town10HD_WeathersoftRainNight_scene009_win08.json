  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a busy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the braking cars.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of multiple braking events. It is changing lanes to avoid potential collisions and maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The pedestrian crossing the street is also a safety consideration for the ego vehicle, and it is adjusting its speed accordingly."
