  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A person is driving a car on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.7 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are tall buildings on either side of the street. The pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk, and there is a large truck parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. The frequent braking events are likely due to the presence of other vehicles on the road, which require the ego vehicle to slow down or stop to avoid collisions. The tall buildings and the presence of pedestrians on the sidewalk also require the ego vehicle to remain vigilant and cautious while driving."
