  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a parked truck on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is dark and rainy, which makes the visibility a bit lower than usual.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rain and the potential risks of pedestrians and other vehicles. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The parked truck on the side of the road might also be a factor in the driver's decision to slow down and be extra careful while driving."
