  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly on a rainy night in a city, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night in a city with the ego vehicle driving slowly on a wet road. The road has multiple lanes and there are several other cars and pedestrians around. The traffic lights are visible in the background and they are showing red and green lights. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is almost stopped at an intersection and there is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on the rainy night to ensure safety and avoid any accidents. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians require the driver to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other objects on the road. The driver is also obeying the traffic signals and stopping at the intersection to avoid any potential collisions."
