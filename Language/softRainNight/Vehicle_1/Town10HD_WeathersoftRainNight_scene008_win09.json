  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing",
  "caption": "A car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city, stopping for a pedestrian to cross the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a car driving slowly on a rainy night in a city. The car stops at an intersection where a pedestrian is crossing the street. There are tall buildings and street lights on both sides of the road. The road is wet and slippery due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The car slows down and stops because it detects a pedestrian crossing the street. The car's sensors detect the pedestrian's presence and trigger the car to stop to avoid a collision. The car's braking system applies the brakes strongly to bring the car to a halt. The car's headlights and taillights are on to improve visibility in the rainy conditions. The car's steering system keeps the car aligned with the road while it stops. The car's speed is almost stopped to ensure the safety of the pedestrian and other vehicles on the road."
