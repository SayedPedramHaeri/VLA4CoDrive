  "title": "Rainy night city driving with pedestrian crossing",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle on a rainy night in a city street with a pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a slow-moving vehicle driving on a rainy night in a city street with a pedestrian crossing. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are several other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrian crossing is clearly marked. The video shows the vehicle braking several times, indicating the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with a pedestrian crossing. The vehicle brakes several times, indicating the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The driver is likely being cautious due to the low visibility and wet road conditions. The vehicle is also following the speed limit and other traffic rules to ensure safe driving. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrian crossing to avoid any accidents."
