  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night in a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying green and red lights. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk and some parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night in a city street. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The presence of other cars on the road and the need to maintain a safe distance between them requires the driver to brake frequently. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging weather conditions."
