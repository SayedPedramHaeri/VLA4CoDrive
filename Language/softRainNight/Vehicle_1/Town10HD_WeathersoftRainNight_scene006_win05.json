  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing.",
  "caption": "A blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are green, and there is a large roundabout ahead. The pedestrian crossing is visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety on the rainy road. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and is prepared to stop if necessary. The pedestrian crossing is a potential risk, and the ego vehicle is alert to any pedestrians who may be crossing the road."
