  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, following a car.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street at night, following a car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a car in front of it. There are other cars on the road, and a bus is parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rainy and dark conditions. It is following the car in front of it to maintain a safe distance and avoid any potential accidents. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road to ensure safe navigation through the city."
