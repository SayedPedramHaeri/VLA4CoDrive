  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night in a busy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.6 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving on a rainy night in a busy city street. The road is wet and slippery, and the visibility is reduced due to the rain. The traffic situation is quite busy, with many other vehicles and pedestrians around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are frequent braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The weather is rainy, and the rain is falling heavily.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a busy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking. The weather is rainy, and the road is wet and slippery. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid collisions. The frequent braking events or strong decelerations indicate that the driver is reacting to the changing traffic situation and trying to avoid potential risks. The driver needs to be aware of the pedestrians and other obstacles on the road and adjust the speed and direction accordingly. The rain and reduced visibility make it even more challenging to navigate the busy city street safely."
