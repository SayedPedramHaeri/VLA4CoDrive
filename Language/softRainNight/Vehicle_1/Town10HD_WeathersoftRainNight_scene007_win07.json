  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing.",
  "caption": "A rainy night city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and a pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are moving slowly. A pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching a pedestrian crossing and the driver is likely to stop the vehicle to let the pedestrian pass safely. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road to avoid any accidents."
