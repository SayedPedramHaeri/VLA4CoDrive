  "caption": "A blue car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is dark and rainy, with visibility slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid potential risks from other vehicles or pedestrians. The blue car is navigating the wet road carefully, and the driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and other road users."
