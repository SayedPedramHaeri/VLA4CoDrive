  "title": "Rainy night city driving with police car",
  "caption": "Police car driving slowly in a busy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The street is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The police car is driving slowly and carefully, following the traffic rules.",
  "reasoning": "The police car is likely patrolling the area to ensure safety and enforce traffic regulations. The driver needs to be extra cautious due to the rainy weather conditions, which can reduce visibility and increase the risk of accidents. The police car's lights are on, indicating its presence and authority on the road."
