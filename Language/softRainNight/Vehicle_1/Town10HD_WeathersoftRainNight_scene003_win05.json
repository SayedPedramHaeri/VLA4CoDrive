  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 17 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the street. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It slows down and changes lanes to maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the drivers are trying to avoid collisions. The large building on the right side of the street may be a landmark or a point of interest for the ego vehicle's navigation system."
