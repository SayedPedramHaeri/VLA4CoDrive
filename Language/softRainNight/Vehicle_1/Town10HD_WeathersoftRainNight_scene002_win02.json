  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 5 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The rain creates a misty atmosphere, and the tall buildings and palm trees give a sense of a tropical city.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy conditions, and the multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and requires extra caution. The presence of pedestrians and other vehicles on the street highlights the importance of attentive driving in such conditions. The tall buildings and palm trees in the background create a unique atmosphere, adding to the overall experience of driving in a city at night."
