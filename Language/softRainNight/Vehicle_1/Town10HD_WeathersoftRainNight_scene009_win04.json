  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "A car drives slowly through a city intersection at night, with rain on the windshield.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly through the intersection because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. It is important to maintain a safe distance from the car in front and to be prepared to stop or change direction if necessary. The rain reduces visibility and increases braking distance, so the driver must be cautious and attentive to avoid accidents."
