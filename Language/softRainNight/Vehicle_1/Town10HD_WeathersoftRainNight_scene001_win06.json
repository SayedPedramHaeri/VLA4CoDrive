  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A white car drives on a rainy city street at night, with a bus and a red car nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently. There are other cars on the road, including a white bus and a red car. The street is illuminated by streetlights and the headlights of the vehicles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid potential hazards on the road. The presence of other vehicles, such as the white bus and the red car, requires the driver to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance."
