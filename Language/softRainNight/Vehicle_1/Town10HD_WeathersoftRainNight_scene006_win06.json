  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, pedestrian crossing.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a blue car in front of it. There are several other cars parked on the side of the road, and a pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk. The traffic lights are visible in the background, and they are all red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the pedestrian crossing. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules, maintaining a safe distance from the car in front. The rainy weather conditions require extra attention to avoid any accidents or collisions. The driver is also paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the street, making sure to give them the right of way."
