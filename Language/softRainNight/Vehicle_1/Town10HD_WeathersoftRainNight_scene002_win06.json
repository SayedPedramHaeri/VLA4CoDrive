  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and 5 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.8 m/s). There are 5 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are several other vehicles on the road, including a white car in front of the ego vehicle. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying green lights. The sidewalks are crowded with pedestrians walking along them. The weather is rainy and the rain is falling heavily on the windshield.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night in a city. The driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions and reduced visibility. The 5 braking events could be due to the driver reacting to pedestrians crossing the road or other vehicles stopping suddenly. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and adjusting their speed accordingly. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and being vigilant in these challenging driving conditions."
