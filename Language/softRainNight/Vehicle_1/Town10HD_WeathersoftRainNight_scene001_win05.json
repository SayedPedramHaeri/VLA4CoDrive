  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, 25 braking events",
  "caption": "A white car drives on a rainy city street at night, with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (softRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The white car is driving slowly, and the bus is following closely behind. There are other cars on the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalks. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and low visibility. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The bus behind it is also driving cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle. The traffic lights are helping to regulate the flow of traffic and prevent accidents."
