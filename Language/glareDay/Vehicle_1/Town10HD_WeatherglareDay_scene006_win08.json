  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a slow-moving car on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet, and there are several other cars and pedestrians in the scene. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is clear.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is moving slowly, likely due to the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The foggy weather may also be affecting visibility, making it harder for the driver to see potential hazards ahead."
