  "title": "Clear day in a quiet city intersection with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly through a city intersection with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The intersection has a traffic light and a crosswalk. There are two other cars on the road, one of them is parked. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible pedestrians or obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching a stop sign. It is also maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The driver is being cautious because of the potential for pedestrians or other obstacles to appear suddenly."
