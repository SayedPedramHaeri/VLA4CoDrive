  "caption": "A city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in the last 8 seconds.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny. There are traffic lights and street signs visible in the video. The road is wet and there are white lines on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because there is a lot of traffic on the road. The driver is being cautious and braking frequently to avoid collisions. The presence of pedestrians and other vehicles on the road requires the driver to be attentive and responsive to changes in the traffic situation. The driver is also following the traffic rules and obeying the traffic lights."
