  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "caption": "A car is stopped at a red light on a city street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several cars and a motorcycle driving on the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the red light, waiting for the signal to turn green. It is surrounded by other cars and a motorcycle, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle must be cautious and attentive to the traffic situation, as there are multiple vehicles and pedestrians in the vicinity. The bright sunlight may also cause glare and affect visibility. The ego vehicle should remain stopped until the light turns green and it is safe to proceed."
