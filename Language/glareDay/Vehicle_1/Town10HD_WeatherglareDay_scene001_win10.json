  "title": "Clear day, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a busy city street with a bus and a truck in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are traffic lights and pedestrians crossing the street. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible fog or rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes frequently, likely in response to the heavy traffic and pedestrians crossing the street. The vehicle's sensors detect the need for caution and the driver responds accordingly to ensure safe driving."
