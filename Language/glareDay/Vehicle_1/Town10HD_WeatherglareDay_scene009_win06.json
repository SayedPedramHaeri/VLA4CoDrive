  "title": "Clear day in a busy city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "caption": "A busy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a busy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are moving while others are parked. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and crossing the street. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or hazards.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection, likely waiting for the traffic light to change. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are moving while others are parked. The pedestrians are crossing the street at the crosswalk. The weather is clear and sunny, which provides good visibility for the drivers. The ego vehicle's braking events or strong decelerations indicate that it is carefully navigating the busy intersection, ensuring the safety of the passengers and other road users."
