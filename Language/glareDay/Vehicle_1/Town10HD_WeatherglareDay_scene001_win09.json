  "title": "Clear day, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a city street with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a white car driving down a city street with a bus behind it. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The weather is clear and the sun is shining brightly. There are tall buildings on either side of the street and a bridge in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and braking frequently, likely due to the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The white car in front of the ego vehicle is also braking frequently, which may be causing the ego vehicle to slow down as well. The bus behind the ego vehicle is also driving at a moderate speed, but it is not braking as often as the other vehicles. The tall buildings and bridge in the distance suggest that the ego vehicle is driving in a city center or downtown area."
