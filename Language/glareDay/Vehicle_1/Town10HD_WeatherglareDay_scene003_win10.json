  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle driving slowly and stopping frequently due to heavy traffic.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with a parked truck and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is red and the pedestrian crossing is empty. The weather is foggy and there is no sunshine.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the heavy traffic and the frequent stopping. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the traffic light and the pedestrian crossing. The parked truck on the side of the road is not obstructing the traffic flow. The foggy weather is reducing visibility, but the driver is using the traffic light to guide them."
