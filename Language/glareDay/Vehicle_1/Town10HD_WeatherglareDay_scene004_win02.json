  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in this window.",
  "caption": "A small white car drives down a foggy city street, with a large white truck parked on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several cars and a bus driving in the opposite direction. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is maintaining a safe distance from the truck on the side and preparing to stop at the red traffic light. The pedestrian crossing the street is also a safety consideration for the ego vehicle."
