  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in this window.",
  "caption": "A white car drives on a foggy city street, with a red truck parked on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with a speed limit of 30 mph. There are several cars and a red truck parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk in the distance. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy weather and the presence of parked cars on the side of the road. It is approaching a red traffic light, and the driver is likely to stop. The red truck parked on the side of the road could be a potential obstacle for the ego vehicle, and the driver needs to be cautious while passing it."
