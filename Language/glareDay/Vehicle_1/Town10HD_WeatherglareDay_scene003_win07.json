  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in this window.",
  "caption": "A white car drives on a foggy city street, with a red truck parked on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with a speed limit of 30 mph. There are several parked cars on the side of the road, and a red truck is parked on the side. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk in the distance. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy weather and the presence of parked cars on the side of the road. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the traffic light and pedestrians. The braking events in this window may be due to the driver's cautious driving behavior or other vehicles in the vicinity."
