  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 14 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a busy city street with multiple other vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.6 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a four-lane city street with a green traffic light and a parked truck on the right side. The weather is clear, and there are several other cars and pedestrians on the street. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and follows a car in front of it.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the car in front of it and slows down when approaching the green traffic light. It prepares to stop when a pedestrian appears on the crosswalk. The parked truck on the right side of the road creates a potential obstacle for turning vehicles. The ego vehicle's moderate speed and frequent braking events suggest cautious driving in a busy urban environment."
