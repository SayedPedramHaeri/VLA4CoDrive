  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "A person is riding a bike on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.7 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and there are several cars and a bus on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a parked truck on the side of the road. The video shows the ego vehicle driving at a moderate speed and braking frequently.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The red traffic light and the parked truck on the side of the road are potential obstacles that the ego vehicle needs to be aware of while driving."
