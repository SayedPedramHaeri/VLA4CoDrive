  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle on a clear day in a city street with 8 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a slow-moving vehicle on a clear day in a city street. The road has two lanes going straight and one lane turning left. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The video shows the ego vehicle braking several times, with an average speed of 4.0 m/s.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously, braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is paying attention to the traffic light and the pedestrian crossing the street. The parked truck on the right side of the road may have obstructed the driver's view of the road ahead, leading to the need for frequent braking. The driver is likely prioritizing safety over speed, given the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians in the vicinity."
