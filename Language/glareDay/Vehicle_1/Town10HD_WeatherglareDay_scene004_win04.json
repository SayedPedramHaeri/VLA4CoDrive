It slows down and stops at the traffic light, following the traffic rules. The driver of the small white car is cautious and attentive, taking into account the foggy weather and the wet road conditions. The white van and other cars around are also driving carefully, maintaining a safe distance from each other and from the small white car. Overall, the scene shows a typical city street with moderate traffic and cautious driving behavior."
