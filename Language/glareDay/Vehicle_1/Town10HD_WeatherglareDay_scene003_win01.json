  "title": "Clear day in a busy city, with the ego vehicle driving slowly and stopping frequently due to heavy traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street, with many other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.1 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes in each direction. There are many other cars and pedestrians around, and the traffic seems to be heavy. The weather is clear, but there is some glare from the sun. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and some parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the heavy traffic. It stops frequently due to the many other cars and pedestrians around. The driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents or collisions. The weather conditions are clear, but the sun glare can be distracting. The driver needs to pay attention to the traffic lights and stop signs to ensure safe driving."
