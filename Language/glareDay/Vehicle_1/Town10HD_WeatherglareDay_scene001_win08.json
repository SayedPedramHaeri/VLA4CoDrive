  "caption": "A white bus drives down a city street with a white car and a red car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with multiple lanes. There are several other cars on the road, including a white car and a red car. The traffic light is green. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and following the white bus. It brakes frequently, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles or pedestrians. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the bus and other cars to avoid any collisions."
