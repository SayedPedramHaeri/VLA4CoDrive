  "title": "Clear day in a busy city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "caption": "A busy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a busy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are moving while others are stationary. A person on a bicycle is crossing the intersection in front of the ego vehicle. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstructions. The road is wet, possibly due to recent rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection, likely because it is giving right of way to the person on the bicycle. The weather is clear, which means visibility is good and there are no weather-related hazards. The road is wet, which could be due to recent rain or a nearby water source. The ego vehicle's braking events suggest that it is carefully navigating the intersection and ensuring the safety of other road users."
