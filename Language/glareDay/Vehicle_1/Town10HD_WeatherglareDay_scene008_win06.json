  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events.",
  "caption": "A police car drives down a city street with its lights on.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a yellow taxi cab driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly. There are several traffic lights along the road, and the police car is driving carefully, with its lights on.",
  "reasoning": "The police car is likely responding to an emergency call or patrolling the area. The driver is being cautious and following all traffic rules, including stopping at red lights and yielding to pedestrians. The bright sunlight may make it difficult to see clearly, so the driver is being extra vigilant to ensure the safety of everyone on the road."
