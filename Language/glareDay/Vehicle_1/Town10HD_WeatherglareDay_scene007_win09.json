  "caption": "A city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in this window.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car in the distance and a white car to the left of the ego vehicle. The road is wet, and there is a tall building in the background. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly. There are several traffic lights and a roundabout in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because it is approaching a stop sign. There are 30 braking events in this window, which suggests that the traffic is heavy and the vehicles are stopping frequently. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road, and it is prepared to stop if necessary. The driver is being cautious and attentive to the traffic situation."
