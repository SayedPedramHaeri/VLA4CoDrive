  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in the last 8 seconds.",
  "caption": "A city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in the last 8 seconds.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are white lines on the road. There is a traffic light on the corner of the street and a red and white sign on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because there is a lot of traffic on the road. The driver is being cautious and braking frequently to avoid collisions. The presence of tall buildings suggests that this is a busy city area. The driver needs to be extra careful because of the potential for pedestrians and cyclists to suddenly appear on the road."
