  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street, following a blue car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car that the ego vehicle is following. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible traffic lights or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed and keeps a safe distance from the blue car in front. It is prepared to slow down or change lanes if necessary, but there are no immediate risks or obstacles in its path."
