  "title": "Clear day in a busy city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "caption": "A busy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a busy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street, and there are several traffic lights and street signs visible. The road is wet, possibly from a recent rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection because there is a red traffic light ahead. The vehicle is braking gently to come to a complete stop. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The driver of the ego vehicle is paying attention to the traffic light and the other vehicles on the road to ensure safe navigation through the intersection."
