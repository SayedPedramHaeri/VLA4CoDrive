  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in this window.",
  "caption": "A white van drives down a foggy city street, with a small white car following it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several parked cars on the side of the road, and a few moving cars. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving very slowly, and it seems to be following the white van in front of it. The driver is likely being cautious due to the foggy weather and the presence of pedestrians and parked cars on the side of the road. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and that the driver needs to be attentive to avoid collisions."
