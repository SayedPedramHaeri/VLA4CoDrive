  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A pedestrian crosses the street in front of the ego vehicle.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with multiple lanes. There are other cars and pedestrians visible in the distance. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching a crosswalk where a pedestrian is crossing the street. The vehicle is braking frequently to maintain a safe distance from the pedestrian and other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and surrounding environment to ensure safe navigation through the city."
