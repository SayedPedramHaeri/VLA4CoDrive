  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. The traffic is moderate, with a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, and there is no visible fog or rain. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are no visible pedestrians or obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed because it is driving in a city environment with moderate traffic. It is keeping a safe distance from the parked cars on the right side of the road. The driver is attentive to the traffic lights in the distance and is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The clear weather conditions allow for good visibility and safe driving."
