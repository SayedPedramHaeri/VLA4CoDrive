  "title": "Clear day in the city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a busy city intersection with multiple cars and pedestrians. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, stopping at a red light. There are tall buildings in the background, and the weather is clear. The road is wet, and there are white lines on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the intersection because it is obeying traffic rules and ensuring safety. It stops at the red light, waiting for the signal to change. The presence of multiple cars and pedestrians in the intersection requires the ego vehicle to be extra cautious. The tall buildings in the background suggest that this is a busy city area, and the clear weather conditions allow for good visibility."
