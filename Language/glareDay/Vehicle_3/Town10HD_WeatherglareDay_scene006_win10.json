  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a city street with multiple other cars and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving down a city street with multiple other cars. The weather is clear, and the road is mostly straight with a few curves. There are several traffic lights and a roundabout. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and frequently brakes. There are also several pedestrians and a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and frequently brakes to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The clear weather allows for good visibility, but the presence of multiple other cars and pedestrians requires constant attention and careful driving. The red light at the intersection ahead requires the ego vehicle to slow down and stop when necessary. Overall, the video demonstrates the importance of safe and attentive driving in a busy city environment."
