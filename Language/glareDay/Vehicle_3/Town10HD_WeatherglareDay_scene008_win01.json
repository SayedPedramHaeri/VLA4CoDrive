  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There is a bus behind it. The road is wet and there are other cars on the street. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy weather conditions. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The red traffic light indicates that the ego vehicle should stop. The pedestrian crossing the street is another potential hazard that the ego vehicle needs to be cautious of."
