  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a city street with other cars and palm trees on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving down a city street with other cars and palm trees on the side of the road. The weather is clear, and the road is wet. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the street. The video shows the ego vehicle braking frequently, and there are other cars on the road, some of which are changing lanes or turning. The video also shows a pedestrian crossing the street at one point.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently, likely due to the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the cars around it. The pedestrian crossing the street adds an additional safety consideration, requiring the driver to be even more attentive and prepared to stop."
