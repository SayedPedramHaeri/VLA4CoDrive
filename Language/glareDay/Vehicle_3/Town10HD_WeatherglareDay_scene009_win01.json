  "title": "CARLA simulation: almost stopped at a city intersection on a clear day.",
  "caption": "A red car drives through an intersection in a city street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving through a city intersection. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there is a green traffic light on the left side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection because there is a red car in front of it. The ego vehicle is following the red car at a safe distance. The green traffic light on the left side of the road indicates that it is safe to proceed. The tall buildings on both sides of the street suggest that this is a busy city area. The wet road may be due to recent rain. The clear and sunny weather is visible in the video, with no clouds in the sky."
