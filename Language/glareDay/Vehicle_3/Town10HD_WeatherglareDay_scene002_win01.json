  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a city with moderate traffic and a red truck parked on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several cars driving in the opposite direction. The traffic light is green and the pedestrian crossing is empty. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching a stop sign. There is a red truck parked on the side of the road, which could potentially obstruct the view of oncoming traffic. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the truck in case it moves unexpectedly."
