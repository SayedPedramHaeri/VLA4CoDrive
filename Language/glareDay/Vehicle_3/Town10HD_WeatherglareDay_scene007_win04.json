  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with palm trees on both sides, following a red car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car that the ego vehicle is following. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are no visible stop signs or crossings.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is following the red car ahead of it. The 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the ego vehicle is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as other cars stopping or slowing down. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the red car and other nearby vehicles, and it is prepared to stop or slow down further if necessary to avoid any potential risks."
