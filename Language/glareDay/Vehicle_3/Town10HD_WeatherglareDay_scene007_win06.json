  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a busy city street, following a red car and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.1 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a 4-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car that the ego vehicle is following. The weather is clear, and there are tall buildings and palm trees lining the street. There are also several traffic lights and a roundabout in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the red car in front of it. It changes lanes to pass the red car and avoid potential obstacles. The driver is cautious and brakes several times to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The weather is clear, which improves visibility and allows the driver to see potential hazards in time. Overall, the ego vehicle behaves safely and responsibly, adapting to the traffic situation and the environment."
