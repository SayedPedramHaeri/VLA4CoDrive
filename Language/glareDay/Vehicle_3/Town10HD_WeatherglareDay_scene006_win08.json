  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car drives slowly down a foggy city street with other cars and pedestrians. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and signs. The weather is clear and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. It frequently brakes to maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The car is also cautious at intersections and crosswalks, slowing down and checking for pedestrians and oncoming traffic before proceeding."
