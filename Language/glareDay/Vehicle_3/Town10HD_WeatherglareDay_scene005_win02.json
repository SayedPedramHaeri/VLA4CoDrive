  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 15 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with moderate traffic and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a truck driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed and follows the traffic rules, slowing down or stopping at traffic lights and stop signs. It keeps a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians, and occasionally changes lanes to overtake slower cars. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic ahead is unpredictable, and the ego vehicle needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid collisions."
