  "title": "Clear day in the city, slow-speed driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white bus follows a red car on a foggy city street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several cars parked on the side of the road. The traffic is light, and the weather is clear. The video shows the ego vehicle braking frequently, and the bus behind it is driving slowly.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the frequent braking events. The bus behind it is also driving slowly, possibly due to the foggy weather conditions. The driver of the ego vehicle needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the bus to avoid any potential accidents."
