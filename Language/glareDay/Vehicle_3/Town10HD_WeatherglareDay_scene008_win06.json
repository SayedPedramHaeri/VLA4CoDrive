  "title": "Clear day in a busy city, with the ego vehicle driving slowly and cautiously.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.8 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving at moderate speeds, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear, but there is a glare from the sun. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are no obstacles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the busy traffic and the need to be cautious. It is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the road signs, and is prepared to brake or change lanes when necessary. The glare from the sun may affect visibility, so the driver needs to be extra careful."
