  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.9 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving around, including a red car and a parked truck. The weather is clear, but there is a lot of traffic on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the heavy traffic and the presence of pedestrians. It is also braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The driver is being cautious and attentive to the surroundings, following the traffic rules and ensuring safety."
