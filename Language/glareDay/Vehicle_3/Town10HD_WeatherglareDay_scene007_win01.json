  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a city street with multiple other cars and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a city street with multiple other cars. There are several traffic lights and a roundabout. The weather is clear and sunny. The road is wet in some parts.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because it is in a city environment with many other cars. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions. The driver is cautious and pays attention to the traffic lights and pedestrians. The wet road may also contribute to the cautious driving."
