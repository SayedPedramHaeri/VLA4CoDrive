  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a quiet city street with parked cars on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane street with parked cars on the side. The weather is clear and sunny. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the video. The traffic lights are all green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is in a residential area with parked cars on the side. It is also braking frequently because there are many parked cars and the road is narrow. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the parked cars in case of any sudden movements or opening car doors."
