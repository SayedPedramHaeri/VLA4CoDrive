  "title": "Clear day in the city, slow-motion driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a city street with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving slowly on a city street with frequent braking. The road is wet, and there are several other cars and pedestrians around. The traffic light is red, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the frequent braking events. The driver is likely reacting to the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The parked truck on the side of the road might have obstructed the lane, causing the driver to slow down and be cautious. The red traffic light also requires the driver to stop. Overall, the video shows a safe and cautious driving behavior in a busy city environment."
