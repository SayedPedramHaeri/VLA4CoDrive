  "title": "Clear day in a city with moderate traffic and a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a city with moderate traffic and a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.8 m/s). There are 22 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic situation is moderate with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and sunny. There are no important traffic lights or stop signs in the scene. The parked truck is on the right side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection and needs to stop and wait for the traffic light to change. The parked truck on the side of the road does not pose any immediate danger, but it could obstruct the view of other vehicles if they try to overtake it. The driver of the ego vehicle should remain vigilant and be prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
