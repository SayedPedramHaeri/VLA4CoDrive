  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle driving slowly and stopping frequently due to heavy traffic.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a busy city street, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.2 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving at moderate speeds, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear, with no visible rain or fog.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping frequently due to the heavy traffic on the street. It is likely that the driver is trying to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The frequent braking events and decelerations in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic situation is quite challenging, with many other cars and pedestrians moving around. The driver needs to be very cautious and attentive to maintain safety in such a busy environment."
