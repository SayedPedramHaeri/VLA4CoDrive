  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle driving slowly and stopping frequently due to heavy traffic.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with other cars and a parked truck on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is low. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the heavy traffic and the frequent stopping and starting. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. The parked truck on the side of the road may be causing some of the traffic congestion. The driver is also being careful to obey the traffic light signals and to watch out for any pedestrians who may be crossing the street."
