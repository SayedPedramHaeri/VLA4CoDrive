  "title": "Clear day in the city, slow-motion driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a city street with tall buildings on either side, and a green car drives behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, including a green car that is following the red car. The weather is clear, and there are no visible traffic lights or pedestrians. The road is mostly straight, but there is a slight curve to the left near the end of the street.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the frequent braking events in the video. The green car behind it is maintaining a safe distance and following the red car's speed. The drivers are likely being cautious because of the tall buildings on either side of the street, which could obstruct the view of oncoming traffic or pedestrians. The drivers are also likely being careful because of the clear day, which could cause glare and reduce visibility. Overall, the drivers are prioritizing safety and following the traffic rules."
