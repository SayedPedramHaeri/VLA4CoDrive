  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a city street with moderate traffic and a few parked cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with moderate traffic. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully. There are a few parked cars on the side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is in a city street with moderate traffic. It is also preparing to stop because there is a red traffic light ahead. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. The parked cars on the side of the road are not causing any obstruction to the flow of traffic."
