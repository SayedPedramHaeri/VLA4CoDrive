  "title": "Clear day in a city with moderate traffic and a red car driving straight.",
  "caption": "A red car drives straight on a city street with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving straight on a city street with moderate traffic. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The weather is clear and sunny. The road is wet and there are white lines on the road. There is a green traffic light on the left side of the road and a red car parked on the right side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving straight on a city street with moderate traffic. It is almost stopped and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The red car is following the car in front of it and maintaining a safe distance. The green traffic light on the left side of the road indicates that it is safe to proceed. The red car parked on the right side of the road is not obstructing the flow of traffic."
