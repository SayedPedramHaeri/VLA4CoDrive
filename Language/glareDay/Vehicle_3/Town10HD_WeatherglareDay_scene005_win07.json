  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly through a city intersection with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly through a city intersection with frequent braking. There are multiple other cars and pedestrians in the area, and the traffic lights are all green. The road is wet from recent rain, and there are trees and buildings lining the streets.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly through the city intersection because of the frequent braking. The driver is likely being cautious due to the wet road conditions and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is anticipating potential risks and is prepared to stop quickly if necessary. The green traffic lights indicate that the driver has the right of way and can proceed with caution."
