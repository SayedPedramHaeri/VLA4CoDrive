  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in the last 8 seconds.",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a city street with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving on a city street with a bus behind it. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the street. The weather is clear and the sky is blue. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street and several palm trees. The video was taken during the day.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because there is a red light ahead. The bus behind the red car is maintaining a safe distance, but there are several other cars on the street that are also braking or stopping. The driver of the ego vehicle must be cautious and attentive to avoid any collisions or accidents. The tall buildings and palm trees suggest that this is a busy urban area with heavy traffic."
