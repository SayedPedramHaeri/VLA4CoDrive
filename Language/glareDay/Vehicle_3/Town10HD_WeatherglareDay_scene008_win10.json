  "title": "Clear day in the city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in this window.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street, with a red car in front of it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving around, and a red car is in front of the ego vehicle. The weather is clear, and there are tall buildings in the background. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk nearby.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The red car in front of the ego vehicle is likely the reason for the braking. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the red car and other nearby vehicles. The parked cars on the side of the road and the tall buildings in the background suggest that this is a busy urban area."
