  "title": "Clear day in a city, the ego vehicle is almost stopped at a red light.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.5 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a four-lane city street with parked cars on the side and a red traffic light. There are several cars and a truck driving on the road, and a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching a red traffic light. It is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it and is prepared to stop if necessary. The parked cars on the side of the road and the pedestrian crossing the street are also visible to the ego vehicle, which is taking into account their presence while driving."
