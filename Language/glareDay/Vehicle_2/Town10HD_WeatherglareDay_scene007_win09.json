  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several cars and a bus on the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because of the red traffic light. It is waiting for the light to turn green before it can continue driving. The pedestrian is crossing the street safely because the traffic is stopped. The tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road add to the urban atmosphere of the scene."
