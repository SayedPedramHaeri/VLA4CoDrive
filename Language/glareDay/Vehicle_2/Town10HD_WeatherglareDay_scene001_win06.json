  "title": "Clear day, moderate-speed city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a busy city street with multiple other vehicles and pedestrians, and there are frequent braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a wide, straight city street with multiple lanes in each direction. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street, and the weather is clear with bright sunlight. The traffic is moderate, with several other cars and a parked truck visible in the distance. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalks. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and occasionally brakes or changes lanes.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving carefully and cautiously due to the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. It slows down or brakes when approaching intersections or when other vehicles or pedestrians are nearby. It also changes lanes occasionally to avoid congestion or to get a better view of the road ahead. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is quite busy and requires the ego vehicle to be attentive and responsive to avoid collisions."
