  "title": "Clear day in the city, slow-speed driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A small car drives on a city street with a bus and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The small car drives on a city street with a bus and other cars. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and parked cars along the street. The weather is clear and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The small car is driving slowly and cautiously, braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and pedestrians crossing the street. The parked cars along the street create a narrow lane, requiring the driver to be extra careful when changing lanes or turning. The clear weather conditions make it easier to see the road and other vehicles, but also require the driver to be aware of potential glare from the sun."
