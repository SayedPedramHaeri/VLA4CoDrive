  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in this window.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the immediate vicinity of the ego vehicle.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped, possibly because it is waiting for a traffic light to change or for other cars to pass. The blue car is driving down the street, maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle. The tall buildings on either side of the road create a canyon-like effect, which may affect the visibility of other vehicles or pedestrians. The 30 braking events in this window suggest that the traffic is congested, and the vehicles are slowing down or stopping frequently."
