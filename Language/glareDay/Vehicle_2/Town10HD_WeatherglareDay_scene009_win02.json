  "title": "Clear day in a city with moderate traffic and a few parked cars.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate with a few parked cars on the side. The weather is clear and sunny. There are several traffic lights and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed and following the traffic rules. It slows down and stops at the red traffic lights. It changes lanes to avoid a parked truck on the side of the road. The driver is cautious and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles. The glare from the sun may affect the visibility of the road ahead."
