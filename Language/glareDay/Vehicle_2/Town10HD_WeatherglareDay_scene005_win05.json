  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a city intersection, stopping at a red stop sign.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street with multiple lanes. There are parked cars on the side of the road and a red stop sign on the corner. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible traffic or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection with a red stop sign. It is braking frequently, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles or pedestrians that are not visible in the video. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and is prepared to stop if necessary."
