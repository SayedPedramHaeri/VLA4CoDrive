  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 11 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street, following a blue car and passing a parked truck. It slows down and stops at a red light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. There are several traffic lights and a roundabout in the distance. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible pedestrians or obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed, following the blue car ahead. It slows down and stops at the red light, checking for oncoming traffic before proceeding. The parked truck on the right side of the road poses no immediate danger, but the ego vehicle should remain vigilant for any sudden movements or pedestrians crossing the street."
