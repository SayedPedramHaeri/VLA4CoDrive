  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with 10 braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street with palm trees and a roundabout.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car drives slowly on a city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side. The traffic light is red, and there is a roundabout ahead. The weather is clear, and the road is wet.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is approaching a roundabout. The driver is being cautious and following the speed limit. There are several other cars on the road, and the driver needs to be aware of their positions and movements. The parked truck on the right side could also be a potential obstacle. The red traffic light indicates that the driver needs to stop. The roundabout ahead requires the driver to slow down and prepare to change lanes. The wet road could be slippery, so the driver needs to be extra careful while braking or turning."
