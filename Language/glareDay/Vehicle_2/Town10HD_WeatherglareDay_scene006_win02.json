  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a clear day in the city, passing a red truck on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. The traffic is moderate, with a red truck and a white van driving in the same direction. There is a green traffic light on the left side of the road, and a crosswalk is visible in the distance. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed because there is no immediate need to slow down or change lanes. It keeps a safe distance from the red truck on the right, and it prepares to pass the white van on the left. The driver is attentive to the green traffic light and the crosswalk, ensuring safe navigation through the city streets."
