  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a clear day, passing a red truck on the left.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a green traffic light on the left. There are several parked cars on the right side of the street. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible pedestrians or obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed and stays in the right lane. It passes a red truck on the left, which is parked on the side of the road. The green traffic light on the left indicates that it is safe to proceed straight. The parked cars on the right side of the street suggest that this is a residential or commercial area. The clear weather conditions allow for good visibility and safe driving."
