  "title": "Clear day, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible traffic lights or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, occasionally braking to slow down or stop. The frequent braking events suggest that the car is navigating a busy city street with other vehicles and obstacles. The driver must be cautious and attentive to avoid collisions or accidents."
