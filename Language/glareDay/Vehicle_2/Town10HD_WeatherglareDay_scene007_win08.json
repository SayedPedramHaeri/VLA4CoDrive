  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events in this window.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with a glare from the sun.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving down the street, and a bus is visible in the distance. The weather is clear, and there are palm trees and buildings in the background. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk nearby.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because of the red traffic light. It is likely waiting for the light to turn green before proceeding. The glare from the sun might also be affecting visibility for the driver. The parked cars and the bus in the distance suggest that this is a busy area with a lot of traffic."
