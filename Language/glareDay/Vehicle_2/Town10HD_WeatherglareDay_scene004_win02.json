  "title": "Clear day in the city, moderate-speed driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side, and a large building in the distance. The road is mostly empty, with only a few other cars and pedestrians visible.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are driving in the opposite direction. A few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible at several points along the road, and they are all showing green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and it is braking frequently, possibly to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The blue car is following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The large building in the distance is a prominent landmark that helps the driver navigate the city. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and adjusting their speed accordingly."
