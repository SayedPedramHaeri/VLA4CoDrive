  "title": "Clear day in the city, slow-speed driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are many other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is red and the pedestrian crossing is empty. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because there are many other cars on the road and it needs to brake frequently to avoid collisions. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the traffic light and pedestrian crossing. The tall buildings on both sides of the street create a canyon effect that can make it difficult to see other vehicles and pedestrians. Therefore, the driver needs to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other objects on the road."
