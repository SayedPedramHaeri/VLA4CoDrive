  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 9 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a busy city street with tall buildings and a red double-decker bus on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and there are several other cars on the street, including a blue car and a white car. The traffic light is green and there is a tall building on the left. The weather is clear and there is a large building in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed and follows the blue car in front of it. It slows down and stops at the red light. It then accelerates and continues driving straight until it reaches the next intersection."
