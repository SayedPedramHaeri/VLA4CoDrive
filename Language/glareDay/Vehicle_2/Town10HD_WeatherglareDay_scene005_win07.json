  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with 7 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a quiet city street with multiple parked cars and a few pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane street with parked cars on the right side. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the street. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good. The pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk, and some are crossing the street at designated crossings.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid collisions with parked cars or pedestrians. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and stop signs to follow traffic rules. The braking events are likely due to the need to stop or slow down for parked cars or pedestrians crossing the street."
