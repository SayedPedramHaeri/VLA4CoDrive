  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 13 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with moderate traffic and 13 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, and there are no visible traffic lights or stop signs. The video shows the ego vehicle driving straight and changing lanes.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed because of the clear weather and moderate traffic. It changes lanes to avoid a parked truck on the right side of the road. The 13 braking events could be due to other vehicles stopping suddenly or pedestrians crossing the road unexpectedly."
