  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with 9 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street with palm trees and a large building in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously, likely due to the high number of braking events in the video. The driver is being extra careful, possibly because of the pedestrian crossing the street. The parked truck on the right side may be obstructing the view of the road ahead, which could also be a reason for the cautious driving."
