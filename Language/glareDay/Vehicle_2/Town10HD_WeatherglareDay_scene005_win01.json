The weather is clear, but the road is wet, which may require the driver to be more cautious. The driver is following the traffic rules and paying attention to the traffic light, which is currently green. The driver is also keeping a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window may indicate that the driver is encountering heavy traffic or some other obstacle on the road.\"",
