  "title": "Clear day in the city, slow-speed driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white and blue bus drives down a city street with a red car following it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.4 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a white and blue bus driving down a city street with a red car following it. There are several other cars on the road, including a black car and a parked blue car. The road is wet and there are tall buildings on either side. The video was taken during the day and the weather is clear.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the frequent braking events. The red car following the bus may be trying to maintain a safe distance. The presence of tall buildings suggests that the road is in a busy urban area. The wet road could be due to recent rain, which would require the drivers to be extra cautious."
