  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street with other cars and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with other cars. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and signs. The weather is clear and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other cars on the road. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The car is also following the speed limits and traffic rules to ensure safe driving."
