  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a clear day, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight city street with 4 lanes and a speed limit of 60 km/h. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, with no visible fog or rain. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road, all of which are visible and in the green state. The pedestrian crossing the street is wearing a blue shirt and is walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed, braking occasionally to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. It stays in the right lane and follows the traffic rules, stopping at red lights and yielding to pedestrians. The parked truck and the pedestrian crossing the street are potential obstacles that the ego vehicle must navigate around carefully. The ego vehicle's sensors detect the presence of these obstacles and adjust its speed and direction accordingly, ensuring safe driving in the city."
