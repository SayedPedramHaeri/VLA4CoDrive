  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.7 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a four-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are moving slowly while others are stationary. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green lights. The weather is clear and there is no fog or rain.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is in a city environment with frequent stops and starts. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful and is prepared to stop at any moment. This is a common driving behavior in busy city streets where there are many pedestrians and other vehicles on the road."
