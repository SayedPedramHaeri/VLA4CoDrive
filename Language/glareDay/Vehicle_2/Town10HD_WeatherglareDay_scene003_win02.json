  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street, changing lanes and following a blue car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and there are several other cars on the street, some of them parked. The traffic light is red and there is a large building in the background. The weather is clear and there are palm trees on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid any sudden braking or obstacles on the road. It changes lanes to get closer to the blue car and to have a better view of the traffic ahead. The driver is cautious and attentive to the surrounding environment, paying attention to the pedestrians and other vehicles on the street."
