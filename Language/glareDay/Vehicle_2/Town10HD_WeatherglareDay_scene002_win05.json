  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with glare.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street with moderate traffic and a glare from the sun.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.3 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. There are several cars and a parked truck on the side of the road. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly, causing a glare on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight at a moderate speed, following the car in front of it. It slows down and brakes three times in this window, possibly due to the glare from the sun or the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver must remain vigilant and maintain a safe distance from the car in front to avoid any potential accidents."
