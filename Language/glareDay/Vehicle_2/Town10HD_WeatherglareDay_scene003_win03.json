  "title": "Clear day in a busy city, with the ego vehicle driving slowly and braking frequently.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving slowly in a busy city. The road is wet, and there are several other vehicles on the road, including a blue car and a parked truck. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is clear. The video also shows a crosswalk and a roundabout.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city, with frequent braking to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions and the presence of pedestrians near the crosswalk. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and the road signs to ensure safe navigation through the roundabout."
