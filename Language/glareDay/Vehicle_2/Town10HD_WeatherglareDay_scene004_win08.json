  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 9 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street with moderate traffic and 9 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, 4-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The weather is clear, with no visible rain or fog. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, with occasional braking events due to other cars changing lanes or stopping at traffic lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from other cars and adjusts its speed according to the traffic situation. It slows down when approaching a traffic light or a pedestrian crossing, and accelerates when it is safe to do so. The driver of the ego vehicle is attentive and reacts quickly to any changes in the traffic environment, ensuring a smooth and safe driving experience."
