  "title": "Clear day, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a white van. The road is wet and there are traffic lights at the intersection. The weather is clear and sunny, with a glare from the sun.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed and frequently braking to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions and the presence of pedestrians and cyclists. The tall buildings suggest that this is a busy urban area with heavy traffic."
