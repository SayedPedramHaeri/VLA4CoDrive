  "title": "Clear day in the city, slow-speed driving with 7 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street with tall buildings and a palm tree on the sidewalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with tall buildings and a palm tree on the sidewalk. There are several other cars on the road, including a white car and a black car. The road is wet and there is a traffic light on the corner. The weather is clear and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the traffic light on the corner. The 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is being extra careful and braking early to avoid any potential accidents."
