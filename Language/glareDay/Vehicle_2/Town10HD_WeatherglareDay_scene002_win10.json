  "title": "Clear day in a city, the ego vehicle is almost stopped at a red light.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a wide city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several traffic lights and signs, and the weather is clear. The traffic is moderate, with other cars driving at moderate speeds. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching a red light. It is also maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and signs, as well as the pedestrians, to ensure safe driving. The braking events and strong decelerations in the driving metadata indicate that the driver is being cautious and prepared to stop at any time."
