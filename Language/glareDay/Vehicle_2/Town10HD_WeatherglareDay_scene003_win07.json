  "title": "Clear day in a city, the ego vehicle is almost stopped at a red light.",
  "caption": "The blue car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with tall buildings on both sides.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red and the pedestrian crossing is empty. The buildings are tall and there are several traffic lights along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is almost stopped at a red light. The foggy weather may reduce visibility for the driver. The presence of other cars and pedestrians on the street requires the driver to be cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents."
