  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 9 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a busy city street, following a blue car and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a 4-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car that the ego vehicle is following. The weather is clear, and there are tall buildings and palm trees lining the street. There are also several traffic lights and a roundabout in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the blue car in front of it. It changes lanes to pass the blue car and avoid getting stuck behind it. The ego vehicle slows down and brakes at several points along the road, including when it enters the roundabout and when it passes through the intersections. The weather is clear, which allows for good visibility and safe driving. However, the ego vehicle must remain vigilant for pedestrians and other vehicles on the road, especially at the intersections and near the parked cars."
