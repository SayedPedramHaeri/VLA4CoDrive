  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly. The ego vehicle is a blue car that is almost stopped, with an average speed of 0.0 m/s. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because it is at a red light. There are several other cars driving in the opposite direction, and the road is quite busy. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly, which could cause glare and make it harder to see the road ahead. The ego vehicle needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents or collisions."
