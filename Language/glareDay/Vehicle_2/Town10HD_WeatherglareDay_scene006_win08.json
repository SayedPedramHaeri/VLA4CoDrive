  "title": "Clear day in a city with moderate traffic and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a city intersection, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving through a city intersection with moderate traffic. The road is wet from recent rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The traffic lights are green, and there are pedestrians crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the intersection because of the frequent braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The wet road surface and the presence of pedestrians crossing the street require the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive to the surroundings. The driver is following the traffic rules and ensuring the safety of all road users."
