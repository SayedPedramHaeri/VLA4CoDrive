  "title": "Clear day in a city with moderate traffic and a few parked cars.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street with a few other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a sidewalk and parked cars on the right side. There are several traffic lights and a roundabout in the distance. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or hazards.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, following the flow of traffic. It slows down as it approaches the roundabout and prepares to make a left turn. The driver is attentive to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road, maintaining a safe distance and speed. The parked cars on the right side of the road do not seem to obstruct the flow of traffic, and the pedestrians on the sidewalk are walking at a steady pace."
