  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle driving slowly and stopping frequently due to heavy traffic.",
  "caption": "A slow-motion video of a city street with lots of cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a busy city street with lots of cars and pedestrians. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue. The road is wet, and there are several traffic lights and signs. The ego vehicle is a small blue car that is driving slowly and stopping frequently due to heavy traffic. There are many other cars on the road, including a parked truck and a white van. The traffic is moving slowly, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalks.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping frequently due to the heavy traffic on the city street. The driver is being cautious and following the flow of traffic. The parked truck and the white van are blocking part of the road, which is causing the traffic to slow down. The driver is also paying attention to the pedestrians on the sidewalks to ensure their safety. The video shows the importance of being attentive and patient while driving in a busy city environment."
