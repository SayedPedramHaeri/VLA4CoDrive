  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street at moderate speed, passing a parked truck and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safe driving in the city. It passes a parked truck and a traffic light, which are both visible in the video. The driver is attentive to the pedestrian crossing the street and adjusts the speed accordingly. The clear weather conditions allow for good visibility and easy navigation of the city streets."
