  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 7 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with 7 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.8 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is green and the pedestrian crossing is empty. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is green and the pedestrian crossing is empty. The ego vehicle is prepared to stop or turn left if necessary. The 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the ego vehicle is encountering some traffic congestion or obstacles on the road."
