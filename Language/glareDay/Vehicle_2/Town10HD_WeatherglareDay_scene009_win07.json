  "title": "Clear day in a city with moderate traffic and a few parked cars.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a city street with a few other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.1 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several parked cars on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly. The traffic is moderate, with a few cars driving in the opposite direction.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. It slows down or brakes frequently to avoid collisions with pedestrians or other vehicles. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and signs, making sure to follow all the rules of the road. The weather conditions are ideal for driving, with good visibility and no obstacles on the road."
