  "title": "Clear day in a city, slow-motion driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a city street with multiple traffic lights and parked cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving slowly on a city street with multiple traffic lights and parked cars. The weather is clear, and the road is wet. The traffic is moderate, and there are several other cars on the road. The video captures multiple braking events, and the ego vehicle is moving slowly throughout the clip.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the high traffic density and the presence of multiple traffic lights. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is stop-and-go, and the driver is reacting to the changing traffic conditions. The parked cars on the side of the road may also be contributing to the slow-motion driving."
