  "title": "Clear day in a city, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and 30 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street with tall buildings on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with tall buildings on the side of the road. There are several cars and a motorcycle on the road. The weather is clear and sunny. The traffic light is red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because of the red traffic light. It is waiting for the light to turn green before it can continue driving. The tall buildings on the side of the road suggest that this is a busy city area. The presence of several cars and a motorcycle on the road indicates that it is a busy time of day. The ego vehicle needs to be cautious and follow traffic rules to ensure safe driving."
