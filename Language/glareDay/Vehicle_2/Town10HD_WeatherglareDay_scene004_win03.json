  "title": "Clear day in the city, the ego vehicle is almost stopped.",
  "caption": "The blue car is driving slowly in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is red and the pedestrian crossing is empty. The weather is clear and there is no fog or rain.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is approaching a red traffic light. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The parked cars on the side of the road and the pedestrian crossing suggest that this is a busy area with a lot of people and vehicles around. The driver needs to be extra careful and attentive to avoid any accidents or collisions."
