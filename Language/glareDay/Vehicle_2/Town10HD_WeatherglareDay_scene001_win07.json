  "title": "Clear day, moderate-speed city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a busy city street with multiple other vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a four-lane city street with parked cars on the side and a bus stop nearby. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a bus driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, and the sun is shining brightly, creating glare on the road. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and the ego vehicle is driving carefully, following the traffic rules.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. It is braking frequently, possibly due to the traffic conditions or the need to stop at traffic lights or stop signs. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safe driving. The glare from the sun may also be affecting the driver's visibility, requiring extra attention to the road ahead."
