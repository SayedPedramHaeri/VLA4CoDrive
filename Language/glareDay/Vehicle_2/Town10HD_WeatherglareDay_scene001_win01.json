  "title": "Clear day in the city, slow-motion driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a city intersection, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly through a city intersection. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet, and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the intersection because of the red traffic light. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and paying attention to the surroundings. The wet road and parked cars on the side of the road may also contribute to the driver's cautious driving behavior. The tall buildings and pedestrian crossing the street indicate that this is a busy city intersection, and the driver needs to be attentive to avoid any accidents."
