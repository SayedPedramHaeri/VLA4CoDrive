  "title": "Clear day, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street with frequent braking. There are other cars on the road, and the traffic light is green. The road is wet, and there are palm trees on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly to ensure safety on a busy city street. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is cautious and pays attention to the traffic light and the surrounding environment, including the wet road and the palm trees on the sidewalk. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being extra cautious and prioritizing safety over speed."
