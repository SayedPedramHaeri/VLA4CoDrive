  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 6 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with moderate traffic and 6 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a 4-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The weather is clear, and there are no visible traffic lights or pedestrians. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are no upcoming intersections or roundabouts.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles. It slows down or brakes when necessary to maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The clear weather conditions allow for good visibility, and the absence of pedestrians or traffic lights reduces the risk of accidents. The parked cars on the right side of the road do not obstruct the ego vehicle's path, and there are no upcoming intersections or roundabouts to navigate."
