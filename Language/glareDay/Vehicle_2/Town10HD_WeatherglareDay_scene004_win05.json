  "title": "Clear day in a city, the ego vehicle is almost stopped at a red light.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street with multiple other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (glareDay). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes, and there are several parked cars on the side. The traffic is moderate, with a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and some of them are red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching a red light. It is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it and is prepared to stop if necessary. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road to ensure safe driving. The parked cars on the side of the road and the pedestrians on the sidewalk add to the complexity of the driving environment, and the driver needs to be extra cautious to avoid any accidents."
