  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street, passing a bus stop and a tall building.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It is passing a bus stop and a tall building, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the ego vehicle is following the rules of the road to ensure safe navigation. The rainy weather requires extra caution and slower speeds to avoid accidents."
