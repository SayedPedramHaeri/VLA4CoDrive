  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.7 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving straight and changing lanes.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy weather conditions. It changes lanes to avoid a parked truck on the right side of the road. The frequent braking events are likely due to the slippery road surface caused by the rain. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the front car and adjusting its speed accordingly."
