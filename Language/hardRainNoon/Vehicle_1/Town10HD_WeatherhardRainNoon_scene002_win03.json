  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives through a rainy intersection in a large city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.0 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving through a rainy intersection in a large city. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are several other cars on the road, including a white bus and a black SUV. The traffic lights are visible in the background and are displaying green and yellow signals. The video also shows a tall building in the distance and a white van parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed due to the rainy conditions, which can affect visibility and road traction. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of the white bus and black SUV suggests that the driver is navigating through a busy intersection, where they need to be attentive to the movements of other vehicles and pedestrians. Overall, the video captures the challenges of driving in a large city during rainy weather, and highlights the importance of maintaining a safe speed and being aware of the surroundings."
