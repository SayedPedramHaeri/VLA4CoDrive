  "title": "Rainy city street with a blue car and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "caption": "A blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and the visibility is low. The blue car is driving slowly and carefully. There is a pedestrian crossing the street and other cars parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing red lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The pedestrian crossing the street is a potential risk and the ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from them. The blue car is following the traffic rules and regulations and is being cautious while driving in the rain."
