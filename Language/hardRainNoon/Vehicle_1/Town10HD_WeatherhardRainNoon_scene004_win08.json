  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings and a green traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is green and the pedestrian crossing signal is lit up. The weather is overcast and there is a large building in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents with other vehicles or pedestrians. The green traffic light and the lit-up pedestrian crossing signal indicate that it is safe to proceed. The large building in the background adds to the urban environment of the city."
