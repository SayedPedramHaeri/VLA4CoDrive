  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white van drives through a rainy city intersection, with a red bus and a parked truck nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the road, including a red bus and a parked truck. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The white van is driving slowly through the intersection because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead, especially because of the hard rain. The parked truck and the red bus are also slowing down the traffic, and the driver needs to be patient and wait for the traffic to clear before proceeding."
