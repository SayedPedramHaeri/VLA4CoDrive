  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, with other cars and pedestrians visible. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are multiple traffic lights and a roundabout in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The white car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It stops at the intersection to wait for the traffic light to change. The driver is cautious and maintains a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. The rainy conditions require extra attention to avoid potential accidents."
