  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 5 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a white car and a red car. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The road is wet and slippery due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes frequently due to the reduced visibility and potential for hydroplaning. The presence of other vehicles on the road requires the ego vehicle to remain vigilant and maintain a safe distance. The rainy weather also affects the behavior of pedestrians and other drivers, making it important for the ego vehicle to anticipate their actions and respond accordingly."
