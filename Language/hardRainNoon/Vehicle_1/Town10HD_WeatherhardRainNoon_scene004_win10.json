  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy conditions, and it frequently brakes to maintain safety. The presence of other cars on the road requires the ego vehicle to be cautious and attentive to avoid any potential collisions. The tall building on the right side of the road may also affect the visibility and driving conditions."
