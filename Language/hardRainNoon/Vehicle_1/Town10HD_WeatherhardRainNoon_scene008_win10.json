  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with pedestrians and other vehicles.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wet intersection with pedestrians and other vehicles. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, almost stopped at the intersection. It is likely reacting to the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles nearby. The rainy weather conditions and the need to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles result in frequent braking events or strong decelerations."
