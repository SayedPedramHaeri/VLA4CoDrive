  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a blue motorcycle parked on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the street. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The blue motorcycle on the side of the road is parked and does not pose a risk to the ego vehicle's trajectory."
