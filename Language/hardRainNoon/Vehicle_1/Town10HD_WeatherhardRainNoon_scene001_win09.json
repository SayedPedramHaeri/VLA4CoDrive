  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a white bus. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs visible in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is approaching an intersection and is about to stop. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of the red car and the white bus in the scene suggests that the driver needs to be aware of the traffic around them and make appropriate decisions to ensure safe driving."
