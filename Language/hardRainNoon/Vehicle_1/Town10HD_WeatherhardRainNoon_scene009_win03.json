  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a rainy city intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly through a rainy city intersection. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are red. The road is wet and rain is falling heavily. The video was taken during the daytime.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the intersection because of the heavy rain and the presence of other vehicles. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The parked truck on the right side of the road may be obstructing the view of oncoming traffic, which is why the driver is being extra careful. The red traffic lights in the distance indicate that the driver needs to stop at the intersection. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging weather conditions."
