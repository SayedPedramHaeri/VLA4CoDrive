  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy day in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The road is wet and slippery, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are several other cars on the road. Some of the cars are parked on the side of the road, and others are driving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. There are also a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously on the rainy city street because of the reduced visibility and the wet road surface. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is trying to maintain a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The presence of pedestrians and parked cars also requires the driver to be extra vigilant and cautious while driving. The rainy weather conditions and the need to avoid accidents make this driving scenario more challenging and demanding for the autonomous vehicle."
