  "title": "Rainy city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A white car drives on a rainy city street, with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of it. The bus behind it is also driving cautiously, following the same safety measures."
