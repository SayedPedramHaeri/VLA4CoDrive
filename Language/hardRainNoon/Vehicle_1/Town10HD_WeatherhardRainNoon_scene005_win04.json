  "title": "Rainy city street with parked cars and a crosswalk, the ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy day, with parked cars on the side of the road and a crosswalk nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.2 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The crosswalk is visible in the distance. The traffic is light, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles in sight. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently due to the rainy conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The parked cars on the side of the road and the crosswalk require the driver to be extra cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents. The driver is likely following the recommended speed for the weather conditions and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles to ensure a safe journey."
