  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and two braking events.",
  "caption": "A white bus drives down a rainy city street while a purple motorcycle drives in the opposite direction.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are several cars and a bus driving on it. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is raining and the road is wet. The two braking events could be due to the slippery road surface or other vehicles stopping suddenly. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles and the pedestrians on the sidewalk."
