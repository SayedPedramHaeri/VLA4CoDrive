  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "A red bus drives on a rainy city street, with a blue car following.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The blue car is following the red bus, and the traffic lights are visible in the distance. The large building on the right side of the road may be an indication of an upcoming turn or intersection. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced, so the ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and be prepared for any potential risks."
