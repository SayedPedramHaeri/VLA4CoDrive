  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving with a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy day in a city with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There is a pedestrian crossing the street, and the traffic seems to be light. The road is wet, and the visibility is moderate. The video captures the raindrops on the windshield and the sound of the rain adds to the atmosphere.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The pedestrian crossing the street is an additional safety consideration for the driver. The rainy weather and the presence of the pedestrian require the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive to the surroundings."
