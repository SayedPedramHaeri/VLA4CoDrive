  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy city street, with a tall building in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road. The weather is rainy, and visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the red traffic light. It is also maintaining a safe distance from the parked truck on the side of the road. The tall building in the background suggests that the ego vehicle is in a city environment. The rainy weather and the presence of other cars on the street require the driver to be extra cautious and attentive to avoid any potential accidents."
