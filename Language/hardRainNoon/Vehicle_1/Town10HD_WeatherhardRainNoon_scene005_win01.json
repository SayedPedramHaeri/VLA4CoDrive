  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.9 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and the visibility is low. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are driving at a slower speed. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing red and green lights. The rain is falling heavily and it is creating a misty effect on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is trying to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. It slows down and brakes when it approaches an intersection or a car in front of it. The rainy weather conditions make it more challenging to see the road clearly and to anticipate the movements of other vehicles. The ego vehicle is equipped with sensors and cameras that help it to navigate safely in these conditions."
