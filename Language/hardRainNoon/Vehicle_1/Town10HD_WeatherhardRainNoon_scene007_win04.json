  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A person is riding a bike in the rain on a busy city street with lots of cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.7 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The traffic is heavy with many cars and pedestrians. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and frequently braking to avoid collisions. There are tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road. The rain is falling heavily and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain to ensure safety. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The rain reduces visibility and makes it harder to anticipate the movements of other road users. The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to avoid hydroplaning on the wet road surface. It is important for the driver to stay alert and focused in these conditions to ensure a safe journey."
