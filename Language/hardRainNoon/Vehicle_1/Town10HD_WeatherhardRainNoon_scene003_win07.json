  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopping at the intersection. The rain is falling heavily, reducing visibility and making the road slippery. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road markings are clearly visible despite the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The vehicle is approaching an intersection, where it is stopping to allow other vehicles to pass. The ego vehicle is also keeping a safe distance from other vehicles on the road, in case they need to brake suddenly. The rainy weather and the presence of multiple vehicles on the road require the driver to be extra cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents."
