  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street, passing a tall building and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The tall building and the parked truck are on the right side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety in the rainy conditions. It keeps a safe distance from the other cars on the road and adjusts its speed according to the traffic flow. The driver is cautious and attentive to the surroundings, anticipating any potential risks such as pedestrians crossing the street or other vehicles changing lanes."
