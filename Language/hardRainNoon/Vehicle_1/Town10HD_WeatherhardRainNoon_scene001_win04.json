  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped, with a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city, with a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The parked truck on the side of the road may have caused the ego vehicle to slow down even more to avoid any potential hazards. The rainy weather and the presence of pedestrians on the sidewalk require the ego vehicle to be extra cautious while driving."
