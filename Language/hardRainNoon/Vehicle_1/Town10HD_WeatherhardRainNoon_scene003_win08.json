  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy city street, with a red truck parked on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving around. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is overcast and gloomy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid hydroplaning on the wet road. It slows down even more when approaching the intersection, where it stops to wait for the traffic light to turn green. The presence of the pedestrian and the parked truck on the side of the road also require the driver to be extra cautious."
