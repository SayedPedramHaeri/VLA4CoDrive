  "title": "Rainy city street with a blue car and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "caption": "A blue car is driving down a rainy city street with a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The blue car is driving slowly, and the pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk. There is a traffic light visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of the pedestrian. The blue car is maintaining a safe distance from the pedestrian and other vehicles on the road. The ego vehicle is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary to avoid any potential accidents."
