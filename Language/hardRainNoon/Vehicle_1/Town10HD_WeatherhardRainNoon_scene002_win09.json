  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.5 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The traffic is moderate with several cars driving in the same direction. The ego vehicle is following a white car and there is a black car parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain control on the slippery road. The driver is being cautious and following the white car at a safe distance. The black car parked on the side of the road may have caused some traffic congestion. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and adjusting the speed accordingly."
