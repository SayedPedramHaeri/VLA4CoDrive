  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle at intersection, other cars and pedestrians nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city street with multiple lanes, parked cars on side, traffic lights at intersection. Ego vehicle is almost stopped, other cars are driving slowly, pedestrians are walking on sidewalk. Weather is rainy with hard rain.",
  "reasoning": "Ego vehicle is almost stopped at intersection because of the rainy weather, which reduces visibility and makes driving more challenging. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other cars and pedestrians, and is prepared to stop or turn as needed. The presence of multiple vehicles and pedestrians in the area requires the ego vehicle to be extra cautious and vigilant to avoid any accidents."
