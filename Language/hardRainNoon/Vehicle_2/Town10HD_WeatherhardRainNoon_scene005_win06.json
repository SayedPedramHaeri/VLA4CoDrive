  "title": "Rainy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple parked cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars and pedestrians on the sidewalk. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk in the distance. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, braking frequently to avoid potential accidents. The presence of parked cars and pedestrians on the sidewalk requires the driver to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other objects on the road. The red traffic light and crosswalk in the distance indicate that the driver needs to slow down and prepare to stop if necessary."
