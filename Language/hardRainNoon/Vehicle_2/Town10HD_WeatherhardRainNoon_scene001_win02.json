  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.1 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving straight and following a car in front of it.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it. The presence of other cars on the road and the tall building suggest that this is a busy city street, and the driver needs to be attentive to avoid any potential risks."
