  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with a blue car turning right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wet intersection with tall buildings, a blue car turning right, and a red car driving straight. The road is slippery and the visibility is low. There are multiple traffic lights and a crosswalk nearby.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection because of the rainy weather conditions. It is waiting for the blue car to turn right and for the traffic light to change to green. The driver is being cautious and driving slowly to avoid any accidents. The rain is making the road slippery and reducing visibility, so the driver needs to be extra careful and attentive to the surroundings."
