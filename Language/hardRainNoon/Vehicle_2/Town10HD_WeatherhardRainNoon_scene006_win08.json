  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car in the distance. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs visible along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly due to the rainy conditions, which can reduce visibility and make it more difficult to control the vehicle. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of the blue car in the distance indicates that the driver is aware of other traffic and is making decisions based on the traffic situation."
