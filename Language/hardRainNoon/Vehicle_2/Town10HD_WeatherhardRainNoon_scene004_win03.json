  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with many other vehicles and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a white van in front of it. There are many other cars and pedestrians on the street, and some of them are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing red and green lights. The buildings on the sides of the street are tall and modern, and they have many windows.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of many other vehicles and pedestrians on the street. It is maintaining a safe distance from the white van in front of it, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The rain reduces visibility and makes the road more slippery, so the ego vehicle is driving cautiously to avoid any accidents. The presence of many other vehicles and pedestrians on the street requires the ego vehicle to be extra vigilant and attentive to its surroundings."
