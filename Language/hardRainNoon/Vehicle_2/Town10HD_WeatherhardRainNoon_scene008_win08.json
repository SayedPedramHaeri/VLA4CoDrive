  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a palm tree on the sidewalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The pedestrian crossing the street is also a potential safety concern, and the ego vehicle adjusts its speed accordingly."
