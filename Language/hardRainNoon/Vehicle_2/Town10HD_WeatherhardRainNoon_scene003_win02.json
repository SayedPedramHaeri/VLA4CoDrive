  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car and a black car. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs visible along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy weather conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of multiple braking events suggests that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be extra cautious while driving."
