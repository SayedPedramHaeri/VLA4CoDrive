  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with a blue car turning right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wet intersection with tall buildings and a blue car turning right. The road is slippery and the traffic is light. The ego vehicle is almost stopped and the visibility is low due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, slowing down before the intersection and stopping to let the blue car turn right. The driver is being extra careful due to the slippery road conditions and the low visibility. The rain is causing the traffic to move slowly and the tall buildings are creating a canyon-like effect with the reflections of the lights on the wet road."
