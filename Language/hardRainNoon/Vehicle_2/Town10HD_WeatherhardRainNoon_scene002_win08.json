  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking. There are other cars on the road, including a blue car in the distance. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are tall buildings on either side of the street and a green traffic light can be seen in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed due to the rainy conditions, which can affect visibility and road traction. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of the blue car in the distance suggests that the driver is aware of other traffic and is making decisions based on the traffic situation. The tall buildings and green traffic light provide context for the location and overall environment of the driving scenario."
