  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings and palm trees on either side, passing an ambulance and a bus.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is overcast, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents with other vehicles or pedestrians. The tall buildings and palm trees on either side of the street create a picturesque urban scene, but they also limit visibility and require extra caution while driving."
