  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with a blue car in front.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy day in a city with the ego vehicle driving slowly on a wet road. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car in front of the ego vehicle. The road is slick from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. The traffic lights are visible in the background, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalks.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front. The rain is reducing visibility, and the driver needs to be extra vigilant to avoid any accidents. The driver is also paying attention to the pedestrians on the sidewalks to ensure their safety. The braking events or strong decelerations in the driving metadata indicate that the driver is being very cautious and braking early to avoid any sudden stops."
