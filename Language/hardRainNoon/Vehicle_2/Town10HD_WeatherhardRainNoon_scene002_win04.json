  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly through a rainy intersection with multiple traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.8 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly through a busy intersection in the rain. There are multiple traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly through the intersection because of the rainy weather conditions. It is important to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to be extra cautious when driving in the rain. The multiple braking events indicate that the ego vehicle is reacting to the changing traffic conditions and trying to avoid potential accidents. The red car is also following the traffic light signals to ensure safe navigation through the intersection."
