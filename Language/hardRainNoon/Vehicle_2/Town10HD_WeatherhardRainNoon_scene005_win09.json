  "title": "Rainy city street driving at moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street, passing a white car and a parked truck on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars and a truck on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the buildings on the left side of the street are partially obscured by the rain. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It passes a white car and a parked truck on the right side of the street. The driver is cautious and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any potential accidents. The rain and the wet road surface increase the stopping distance and require the driver to be more attentive to the traffic situation."
