  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings and a blue car in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes frequently to avoid potential risks from other vehicles or pedestrians. The tall buildings on either side of the street create a canyon-like effect that can affect the visibility and the wind direction. The ego vehicle must be cautious and attentive to its surroundings to ensure a safe journey."
