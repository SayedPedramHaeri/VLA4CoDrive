  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and slippery. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the drivers are being extra careful. The driver of the red car is paying close attention to the road and the traffic ahead to avoid any accidents."
