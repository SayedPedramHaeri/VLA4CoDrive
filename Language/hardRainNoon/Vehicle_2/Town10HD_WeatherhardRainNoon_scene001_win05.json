  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a white bus. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are tall buildings and palm trees lining the street. The traffic light is red and the pedestrian crossing is empty.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The red car and the white bus are also driving slowly, likely due to the rain. The tall buildings and palm trees suggest that this is an urban area. The driver is paying attention to the traffic light and the pedestrian crossing to ensure safety."
