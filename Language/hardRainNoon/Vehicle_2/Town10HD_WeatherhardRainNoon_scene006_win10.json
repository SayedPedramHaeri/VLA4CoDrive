  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate braking",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a blue car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying red and yellow lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. It slows down and brakes frequently to maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead of it. The blue car in front acts as a reference vehicle, guiding the ego vehicle's speed and behavior. The rainy weather conditions require the ego vehicle to be extra vigilant and cautious to avoid any accidents or collisions."
