  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a roundabout.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The blue car is driving slowly and carefully, following a white van. There are other cars on the road, and a red car is parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing red lights. The roundabout is also visible, and it is empty.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rainy weather conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the drivers are being cautious. The blue car is maintaining a safe distance from the white van in front of it, and it is prepared to stop if necessary. The roundabout is empty, which is unusual for a city street, and it may indicate that the traffic is being diverted due to the weather conditions."
