  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with blue car and bus in view",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wet intersection with a blue car and a bus in view. The road is slick and the traffic is light. The ego vehicle is almost stopped and the braking is frequent.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, slowing down to almost a stop at the intersection. It is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car and the bus, and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The rain is reducing visibility and making the road slippery, so the ego vehicle is taking extra precautions to ensure safety."
