  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "A red bus drives on a rainy city street, with a white van following.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the street, including a red bus and a white van. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the red bus in front of it. It is maintaining a safe distance from the bus and other vehicles on the road. The rainy weather conditions may affect the visibility and road conditions, so the ego vehicle needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any potential risks."
