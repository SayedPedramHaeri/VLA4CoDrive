  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents. The presence of other cars and pedestrians on the street requires the driver to be extra cautious and attentive to their movements."
