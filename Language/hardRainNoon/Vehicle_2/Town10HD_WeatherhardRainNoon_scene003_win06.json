  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs visible along the street.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly due to the rainy conditions and the high frequency of braking events by other vehicles on the road. The driver is likely being cautious to avoid any potential accidents. The presence of tall buildings suggests that this is a busy urban area where drivers need to be extra vigilant."
