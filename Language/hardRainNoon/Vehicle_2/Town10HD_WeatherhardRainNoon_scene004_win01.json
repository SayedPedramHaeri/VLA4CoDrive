  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly down a rainy city street. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are multiple braking events. The traffic light is red and there is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly down the rainy city street because of the hardRainNoon weather conditions. The multiple braking events are likely due to the wet road surface and the need to maintain safe driving conditions. The parked truck on the side of the road may also be contributing to the congestion on the street."
