  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped, with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, with a bus and other cars around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings on both sides. The traffic is light, with a few cars driving slowly. The bus is on the right side of the road, and there is a parked truck on the left. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the other cars. The bus and the parked truck are potential obstacles that the ego vehicle needs to be aware of while driving. The red traffic light and the crosswalk in the distance suggest that the ego vehicle should be prepared to stop or slow down further if necessary."
