  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with a blue car turning right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wet intersection with tall buildings, a blue car turning right, and a red car driving straight. The road is slippery and the visibility is low. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also slowing down.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped at the intersection because of the rainy weather conditions. It is important to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any accidents. The blue car turning right is also following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle. The red car driving straight is also slowing down to adjust to the slippery road conditions."
