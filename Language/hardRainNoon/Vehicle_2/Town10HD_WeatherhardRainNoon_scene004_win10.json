  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving down a rainy city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a white car and a parked blue car. The road is wet and there are puddles of water. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green lights. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving down the rainy city street at a moderate speed because it needs to maintain control on the wet road. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and trying to avoid any potential accidents. The presence of other cars on the road and the need to follow traffic rules and signals are also important factors influencing the driving behavior of the ego vehicle."
