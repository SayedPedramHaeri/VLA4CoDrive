  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side and a blue motorcycle in the opposite direction.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.3 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are wearing raincoats and are mostly staying under the awnings of the buildings. The ego vehicle is driving carefully and slowly, trying to avoid any potential accidents due to the slippery road conditions.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy weather conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is heavy and the drivers are trying to maintain a safe distance from each other. The tall buildings on either side of the street create a canyon-like effect, which can make it difficult to see any potential hazards ahead. The ego vehicle is trying to stay in the right lane and avoid any sudden lane changes or turns, which could lead to accidents. Overall, the ego vehicle is prioritizing safety and cautious driving in these challenging weather conditions."
