  "title": "Rainy city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "Rainy city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving with the ego vehicle almost stopped. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are red. The sidewalks are empty and there are no pedestrians visible.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rainy city. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver needs to be extra cautious in these conditions to ensure safety. The rain reduces visibility and makes it harder to anticipate the movements of other drivers. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it and is prepared to stop if necessary."
