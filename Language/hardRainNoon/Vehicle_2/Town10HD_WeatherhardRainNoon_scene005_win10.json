  "title": "Rainy city street driving at moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street, passing parked cars and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the street. The pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk, and there is a traffic light visible in the distance. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It is passing parked cars and a pedestrian crossing the street, and it is important to stay alert and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians in these conditions. The traffic light in the distance is visible, and the ego vehicle is following the traffic rules by driving at an appropriate speed."
