  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.1 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the street. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving carefully and slowly, braking frequently to avoid any accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rainy conditions, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful, possibly due to the reduced visibility caused by the rain. The tall building on the right side of the street may also be a factor, as it could obstruct the view of oncoming traffic or pedestrians crossing the street."
