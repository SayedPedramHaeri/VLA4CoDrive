  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly through a rainy city intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly through a busy city intersection. There are multiple cars and pedestrians around, and the traffic lights are showing green and yellow signals. The rain is heavy, and the visibility is low. The road is wet and slippery.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly through the intersection because of the heavy rain and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic signals. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as cars stopping or pedestrians crossing the road. The driver is also adjusting the speed and direction of the vehicle to navigate the wet and slippery road surface safely."
