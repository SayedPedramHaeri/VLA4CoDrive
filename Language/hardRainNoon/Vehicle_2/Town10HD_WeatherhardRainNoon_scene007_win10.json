  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with blue car in front.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wet intersection with blue car in front. The road is slippery and the visibility is low. There are several other cars and pedestrians on the road, and the traffic lights are red. The ego vehicle is almost stopped and the driver is cautious.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, approaching an intersection with a blue car in front. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the car in front. The rain is making the road slippery and reducing visibility, so the driver is paying extra attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, likely because of the rain and the presence of the blue car in front. The driver is being careful not to brake too suddenly or make any sudden turns that could cause an accident."
