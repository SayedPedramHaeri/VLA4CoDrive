  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The road is wet and slippery due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the other vehicles on the road are also adapting their driving behavior to the slippery road conditions. The parked truck on the right side of the street may have obstructed the left lane, forcing the blue car to stay in the right lane. The traffic lights in the distance are not visible enough to affect the driving behavior of the blue car."
