  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and slippery. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible at the intersection. The weather is rainy and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the drivers are trying to avoid accidents. The wet road surface increases the chances of skidding and losing control of the vehicle. Therefore, the driver is driving slowly and carefully to ensure safety."
