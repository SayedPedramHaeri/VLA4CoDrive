  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a motorcycle rider.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the street. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested, and the ego vehicle is trying to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of it. The tall buildings and the motorcycle rider add to the complexity of the driving situation, requiring the ego vehicle to be extra vigilant and cautious."
