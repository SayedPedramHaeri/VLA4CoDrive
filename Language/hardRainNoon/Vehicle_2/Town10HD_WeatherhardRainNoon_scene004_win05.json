  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street, with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopping at the intersection. The rain is falling heavily, reducing visibility and making the road slippery. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road markings are clearly visible despite the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The car is approaching an intersection, where it is stopping to allow other vehicles to pass. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules, which is important for safety in these conditions. The car's braking system is being used frequently to slow down and stop, which is necessary to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road."
