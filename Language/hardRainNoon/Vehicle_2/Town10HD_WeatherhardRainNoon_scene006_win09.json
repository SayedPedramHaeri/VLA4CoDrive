  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are many other cars on the road, and some pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalk. The road is wet, and the visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the driver is constantly adjusting the speed to avoid collisions. The rainy weather also means that the visibility is reduced, and the driver needs to be extra vigilant to ensure safety."
