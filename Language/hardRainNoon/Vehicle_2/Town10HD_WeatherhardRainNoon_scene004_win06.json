  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 26 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and the weather is overcast. The rain is falling heavily and the visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions and to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the road conditions, adjusting the speed and direction accordingly."
