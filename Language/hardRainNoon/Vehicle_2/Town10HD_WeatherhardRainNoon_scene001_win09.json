  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy day in the city.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy day in the city. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a white bus. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs visible in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of the red car and the white bus suggests that the driver is navigating through a busy intersection. The traffic lights and street signs provide guidance on the rules of the road and help the driver make safe decisions while driving."
