  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side and a blue car in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The traffic is light and the pedestrians are using umbrellas to shield themselves from the rain. The rain is falling heavily and the visibility is reduced. The traffic lights are clearly visible and are displaying red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid potential hazards and to ensure safe driving. The rainy weather conditions require extra caution and the ego vehicle is taking the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of its passengers."
