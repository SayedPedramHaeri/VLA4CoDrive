  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with a blue car turning right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wet intersection with multiple cars and a blue car turning right. The ego vehicle is almost stopped and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, slowing down to almost a stop at the intersection. It is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car turning right, and is prepared to react to any potential risks from other vehicles or pedestrians. The rainy weather conditions require extra attention to visibility and road conditions to ensure safe driving."
