  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a roundabout.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the street. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful to avoid any potential accidents. The roundabout and the traffic light add complexity to the driving situation, requiring the driver to pay close attention to the road and the surrounding environment."
