  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with multiple parked cars and a blue car in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.1 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the street. The traffic is moderate, with a blue car in the distance. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents. The driver must be cautious and attentive to the traffic situation, as the rain and reduced visibility can make it difficult to see other vehicles and pedestrians. The ego vehicle must also pay attention to the traffic lights and street signs to ensure it follows the rules of the road."
