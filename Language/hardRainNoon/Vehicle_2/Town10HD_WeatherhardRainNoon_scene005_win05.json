  "title": "Rainy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic light is red and there is a stop sign on the right side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on the rainy city street to avoid any potential accidents. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The wet road surface and reduced visibility due to rain require the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive to the surroundings. The parked truck on the right side of the road and the red traffic light indicate that the driver needs to slow down and stop when required."
