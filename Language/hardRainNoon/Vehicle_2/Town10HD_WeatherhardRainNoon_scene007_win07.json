  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped, with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The blue car is driving slowly and carefully, following a white car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a black car. Pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalks, and there are traffic lights and street signs visible throughout the scene. The weather is rainy, and the rain is falling heavily at times.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully due to the rainy weather conditions. It maintains a safe distance from the car in front of it and adjusts its speed according to the traffic situation. The multiple braking events indicate that the other cars on the road are also adapting their driving behavior to the challenging conditions. The ego vehicle's main goal is to reach its destination safely and without any accidents."
