  "title": "Rainy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, including a blue car in the distance. The traffic lights are visible and are displaying red and green lights. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are wearing raincoats and are walking carefully. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and is following the blue car at a safe distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down the rainy city street to ensure safety. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars on the road are also driving cautiously due to the weather conditions. The red and green traffic lights are visible and are helping to regulate the flow of traffic. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are also walking carefully to avoid slipping on the wet surface. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front of it to avoid any potential accidents."
