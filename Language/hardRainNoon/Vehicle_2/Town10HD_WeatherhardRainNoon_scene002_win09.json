  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying red and green lights. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are wearing raincoats and are walking cautiously.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to ensure safety. It slows down even more when approaching intersections or when other vehicles brake suddenly. The rain reduces visibility and makes it harder to judge distances, so the ego vehicle maintains a safe following distance. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and requires extra caution. The ego vehicle's sensors detect the braking events and adjust the speed accordingly to avoid collisions."
