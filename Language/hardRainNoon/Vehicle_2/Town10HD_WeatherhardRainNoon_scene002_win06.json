  "title": "Rainy city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is slightly reduced. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk, and the parked truck is on the right side of the road. The traffic light ahead is red, and the ego vehicle is driving straight.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It is keeping a safe distance from the parked truck and the pedestrian crossing the street. The red traffic light ahead indicates that the ego vehicle should continue driving straight, and it is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary."
