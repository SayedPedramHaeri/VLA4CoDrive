  "title": "Rainy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are multiple parked cars on the side of the road and a blue car driving in the opposite direction. The road is wet and there are several puddles on the ground. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly on the rainy city street to ensure safety and avoid any potential accidents. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the road conditions. The presence of parked cars and the pedestrian crossing the street require the driver to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians."
