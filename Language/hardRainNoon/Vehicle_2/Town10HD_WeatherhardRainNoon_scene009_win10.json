  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid potential risks from other vehicles or pedestrians. The tall buildings in the background add to the urban environment of the city."
