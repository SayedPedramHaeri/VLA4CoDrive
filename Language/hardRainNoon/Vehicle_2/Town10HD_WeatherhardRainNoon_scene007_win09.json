  "caption": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection, with blue car in front.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city driving on a wet intersection with blue car in front. Traffic is light and the road is slick. The ego vehicle is almost stopped and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, slowing down to almost a stop at the intersection. It is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front, which is also braking frequently. The wet road conditions and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians require the driver to be extra vigilant and cautious. The ego vehicle is likely using its sensors and machine learning algorithms to detect potential risks and plan its movements accordingly."
