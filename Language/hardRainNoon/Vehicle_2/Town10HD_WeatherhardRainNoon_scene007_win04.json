  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car and a parked silver car. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs visible in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and reacting to changing traffic conditions. The presence of other cars on the road requires the driver to be attentive and prepared to stop or change lanes as needed."
