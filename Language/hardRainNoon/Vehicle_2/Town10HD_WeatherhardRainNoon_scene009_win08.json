  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, including a white car and a blue car. The road is wet from the rain, and there are puddles on the ground. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly down the rainy city street because of the hardRainNoon weather conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars on the road are also adjusting their speed due to the wet road conditions. The red car is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and is prepared to stop if necessary. The pedestrian crossing the street is another potential safety concern that the red car is aware of and is adjusting its speed accordingly."
