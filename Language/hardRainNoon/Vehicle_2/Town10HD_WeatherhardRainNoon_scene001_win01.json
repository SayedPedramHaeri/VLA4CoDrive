  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are multiple traffic lights and parked cars along the street. The road is wet and slippery due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents with other vehicles or pedestrians. The rain reduces visibility and requires the driver to be extra cautious when navigating the city street."
