  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The rain is heavy, and visibility is reduced. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet and slippery.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is cautious and attentive, adjusting the speed and direction according to the changing traffic conditions. The rainy weather and reduced visibility make it important to stay alert and follow traffic rules to ensure safe driving."
