  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving down a rainy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying red and green lights. The buildings and street signs are also visible in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed due to the rainy conditions, which can affect visibility and road traction. The frequent braking events may be due to the presence of other vehicles on the road, some of which are also braking. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead and is prepared to stop or slow down as needed. The rainy weather requires extra caution and attention to the road and traffic conditions."
