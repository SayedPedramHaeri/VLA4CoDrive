  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are multiple traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The weather is rainy and visibility is low. The road is wet and slippery.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents. The driver is cautious and pays close attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The rainy weather and wet road surface require the driver to adjust their speed and braking distance to ensure safe driving."
