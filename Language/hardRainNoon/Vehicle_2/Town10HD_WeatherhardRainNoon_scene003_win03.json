  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly through a rainy city intersection, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly through a busy city intersection. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car and a parked black truck. The traffic lights are green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The rain is heavy, and the visibility is low. The road is wet and slippery.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly through the intersection because of the heavy rain and low visibility. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians. The parked black truck obstructs one lane, forcing the red car to change lanes. The blue car is also driving slowly, following the red car's lead. The pedestrian is crossing the street cautiously, taking advantage of the red car's slow speed to cross safely. Overall, the red car is driving defensively to ensure the safety of itself and others on the road."
