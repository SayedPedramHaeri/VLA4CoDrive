  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.7 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The rain is heavy, and the visibility is somewhat reduced. The road is wet, and there are several puddles forming on the ground.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly down the rainy city street because of the heavy rain and reduced visibility. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars on the road are also experiencing difficulty navigating the wet conditions. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the cars ahead and adjusting its speed accordingly to avoid any potential accidents."
