  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a roundabout.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are multiple cars and a white van on the road. The road is wet and slippery. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is rainy and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the driver is constantly adjusting the speed to avoid any accidents. The pedestrian crossing the street and the red traffic light are also important safety considerations that the driver is taking into account."
