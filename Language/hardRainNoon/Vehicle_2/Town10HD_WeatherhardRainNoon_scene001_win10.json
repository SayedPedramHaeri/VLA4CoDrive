  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are many other cars on the road, and some of them are also braking frequently. The road is wet and slippery, and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk ahead.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safety. The presence of tall buildings and palm trees suggests that this is a city street, and the driver needs to be extra careful while driving in such an environment."
