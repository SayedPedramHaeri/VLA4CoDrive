  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a rainy city street, with a motorcycle and a black car nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars and a motorcycle on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a tall building in the background. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the red traffic light. It is about to stop at the intersection, and there is a black car and a motorcycle nearby. The tall building in the background suggests that the intersection is located in a commercial area of the city."
