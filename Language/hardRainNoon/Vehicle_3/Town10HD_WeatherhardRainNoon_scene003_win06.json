  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A green car drives on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a green car driving on a rainy city street. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate. There are no pedestrians or obstacles visible in the video.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the weather is rainy and the road is wet. The vehicle is braking frequently because there are several other cars on the street and the driver needs to maintain a safe distance. The green traffic lights in the distance indicate that the ego vehicle has the right of way and can continue driving. The driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any potential risks on the road."
