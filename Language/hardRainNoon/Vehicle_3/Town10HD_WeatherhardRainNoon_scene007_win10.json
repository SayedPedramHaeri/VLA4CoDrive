  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain on a city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving on a rainy city street. The car is almost stopped and there are several other cars on the road. The road is wet and visibility is low due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs visible in the background. The video also shows a tall building and a palm tree on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, stopping at an intersection. The driver is being cautious due to the low visibility and wet road conditions. The presence of other cars on the road and the need to obey traffic signals are also important considerations for safe driving in these conditions. The driver is likely using the vehicle's sensors and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to help navigate the challenging weather conditions."
