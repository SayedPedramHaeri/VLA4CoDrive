  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving down a rainy city street. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing red and green lights. The weather is rainy and visibility is low. The video shows the ego vehicle braking multiple times, with an average speed of almost stopped.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving down the rainy city street and braking multiple times due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safety. The rainy weather reduces visibility and makes it harder to anticipate the movements of other vehicles on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and adjusting its speed according to the traffic conditions."
