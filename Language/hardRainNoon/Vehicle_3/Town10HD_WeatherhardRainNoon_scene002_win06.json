  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and two braking events.",
  "caption": "A green car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings and palm trees on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a red car parked on the side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and slows down for two braking events.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving carefully in the rain to avoid any accidents. It maintains a safe distance from other vehicles on the road and slows down for the braking events. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The tall buildings and palm trees on either side of the road create a scenic view, but the driver remains focused on the road ahead."
