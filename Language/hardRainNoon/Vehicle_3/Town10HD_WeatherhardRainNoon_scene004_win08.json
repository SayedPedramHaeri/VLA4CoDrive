  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.9 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet from the rain. The weather is overcast and gloomy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down the rainy city street to maintain safety and avoid hydroplaning. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars on the road are also adjusting their speed to accommodate the slippery road conditions. The parked truck on the right side of the street may be obstructing the view of oncoming traffic, which could be another reason for the cautious driving behavior."
