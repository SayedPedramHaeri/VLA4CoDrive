  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, including a white van and a parked truck. The traffic lights are visible and display red and green lights. The pedestrians are also present on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down the rainy city street because of the hardRainNoon weather conditions and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The red and green traffic lights are visible and the driver is following the traffic rules. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are also visible and the driver is being careful around them. The parked truck is blocking one lane and the driver is maneuvering around it."
