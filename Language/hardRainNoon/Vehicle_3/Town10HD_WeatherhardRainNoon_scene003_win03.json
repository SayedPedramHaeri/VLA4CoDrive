  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down a rainy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car in the distance and a white car to the right. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are also several traffic lights and street signs visible along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars are also adjusting their speed to accommodate the slippery road surface. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and is prepared to brake or change lanes as needed to avoid any potential accidents."
