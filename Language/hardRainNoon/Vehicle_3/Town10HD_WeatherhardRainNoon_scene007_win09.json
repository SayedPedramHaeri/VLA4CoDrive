  "description": "The video shows a red car driving in the rain on a busy city street. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are other cars and pedestrians on the street. The ego vehicle is almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to avoid any accidents. It is approaching an intersection and is about to stop. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The rain is making it difficult to see clearly and the driver needs to be extra careful to ensure safety."
