  "title": "Rainy city driving, ego vehicle moving slowly, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A rainy day in the city, the ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.8 m/s). There are 22 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the corner. The pedestrians are wearing raincoats and are walking carefully on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is moving slowly because of the rainy conditions, and it is braking frequently to avoid potential accidents. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safety. The large building on the corner may be a landmark or a point of interest, and the pedestrians are also adapting to the weather conditions by walking carefully on the sidewalk."
