  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate braking",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with moderate braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are other cars on the road, including a blue car and a green car. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are traffic lights and street signs along the road, and the ego vehicle is following the traffic rules.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy day to ensure safety. The braking events are likely due to the reduced visibility and slippery road conditions. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and adjusting its speed according to the traffic flow."
