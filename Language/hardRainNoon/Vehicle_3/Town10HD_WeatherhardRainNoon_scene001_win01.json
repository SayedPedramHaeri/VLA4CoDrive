  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain on a city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving on a rainy city street. The car is almost stopped and there are multiple other vehicles on the road. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street and several traffic lights and street signs. The video also shows a green traffic light and a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to ensure safety. It slows down even more when approaching the intersection, where it stops to wait for the green traffic light. The rainy weather conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road require the driver to be extra cautious and maintain a safe distance from other cars. The parked truck on the side of the road could also be a potential obstacle for the ego vehicle, especially if it needs to change lanes."
