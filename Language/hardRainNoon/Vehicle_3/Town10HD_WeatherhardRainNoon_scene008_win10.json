  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "A red car drives through a rainy intersection, with a white and blue bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly through the intersection because of the rain and the red traffic light. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and keeping an eye out for pedestrians. The bus behind it is also driving slowly, following the same cautious approach."
