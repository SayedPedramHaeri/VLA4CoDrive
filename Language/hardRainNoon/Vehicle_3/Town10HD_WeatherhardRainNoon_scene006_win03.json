  "title": "Rainy city street driving at moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy city street, following a red car and passing a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars and a truck on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the buildings on the sides of the street are illuminated by the rain. The visibility is moderate, and the rain is falling heavily.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the red car in front of it, and it is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The parked truck on the side of the road is not obstructing the flow of traffic, but the ego vehicle needs to be cautious of other vehicles and pedestrians who may be affected by the rain. The rainy weather conditions require the ego vehicle to drive more carefully and attentively to ensure the safety of all road users."
