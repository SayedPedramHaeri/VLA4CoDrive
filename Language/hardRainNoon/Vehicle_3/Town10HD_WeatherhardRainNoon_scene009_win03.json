  "title": "Rainy city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street, with a white and blue bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The bus is driving behind the red car, and there is a green car parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the frequent braking events. It is also maintaining a safe distance from the bus behind it. The red car in front of the ego vehicle is changing lanes, which requires the ego vehicle to slow down further. The parked green car on the side of the road is not a threat, but it is important for the ego vehicle to be aware of its presence to avoid any sudden movements from other drivers."
