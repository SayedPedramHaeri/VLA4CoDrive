  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings and a green vehicle in the foreground.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.8 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully due to the rain and the presence of other vehicles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it and adjusting its speed according to the traffic conditions. It is also paying close attention to the pedestrians and other obstacles on the road. The rain is reducing visibility, so the ego vehicle is relying on its sensors and the traffic signals to navigate safely. Overall, the ego vehicle is demonstrating cautious and responsible driving behavior in challenging weather conditions."
