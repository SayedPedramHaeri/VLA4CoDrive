  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 5.0 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building in the background. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain control on the slippery road. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The rainy weather conditions make it even more challenging to navigate the city streets safely."
