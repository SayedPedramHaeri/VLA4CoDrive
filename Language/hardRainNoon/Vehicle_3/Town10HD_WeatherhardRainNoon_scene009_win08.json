  "title": "Rainy city driving with a white bus and a red car on the road.",
  "caption": "The white bus is driving on the right side of the road while the red car is driving on the left side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The traffic is light and the weather is overcast. The bus is moving slowly and the car is following it at a safe distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving carefully in the rain, maintaining a safe distance from the bus in front of it. It slows down or brakes when necessary to avoid any potential accidents. The rain reduces visibility and makes the road slippery, so the vehicle needs to be extra cautious. The bus and the car are both following the traffic rules and signals, and the ego vehicle is constantly monitoring its surroundings to ensure a safe journey."
