  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a rainy city street. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down the rainy city street because of the hardRainNoon weather conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the other vehicles on the road are also adapting their driving behavior to the slippery road conditions. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance to the front car and is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary."
