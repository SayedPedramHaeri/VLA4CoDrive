  "title": "Rainy city street driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A green car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side and a red car in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The traffic is light and the pedestrians are using umbrellas to shield themselves from the rain. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid potential hazards and to ensure safe driving. The rain reduces visibility and requires the driver to be extra cautious and attentive to the surroundings."
