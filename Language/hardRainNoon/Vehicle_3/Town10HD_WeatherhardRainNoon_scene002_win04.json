  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side. There are multiple braking events and other cars on the road. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy day to ensure safety. It slows down and brakes frequently due to the wet road conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The tall buildings on either side of the street create a canyon-like effect, further reducing visibility. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from other vehicles and adjusts its speed according to the traffic situation to avoid any potential accidents."
