  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are several traffic lights and crosswalks in the area, and the pedestrians are wearing raincoats.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy weather conditions, which can reduce visibility and make it harder to control the vehicle. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars on the road are also experiencing difficulty navigating the wet road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and is prepared to stop or change lanes as needed to avoid any potential accidents."
