  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain, stopping at intersection, other cars and buses on the road",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy city street with multiple lanes, red car driving slowly and stopping at intersection. Other cars and a bus are also on the road. Traffic lights are visible in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, stopping at the intersection to wait for the traffic light to change. The driver is cautious and maintains a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The rain reduces visibility and requires extra attention to avoid potential accidents."
