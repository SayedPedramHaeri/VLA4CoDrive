  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.1 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a rainy city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car in the distance and a black car to the left. The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings and palm trees lining the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is overcast.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid potential risks from other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is cautious and attentive, adjusting the speed and distance from other cars accordingly. The rain and wet road surface require extra attention to avoid any accidents or loss of control."
