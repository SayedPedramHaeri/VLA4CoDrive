  "title": "Rainy city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving on a rainy city street with moderate speed. The road is wet and there are several other vehicles on the road, including a red car and a parked truck. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy weather conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid potential risks on the road, such as the parked truck and the pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle also adjusts its speed and distance to other vehicles to maintain safety while driving in the rain."
