  "title": "Rainy city driving with a red car and a bus on the road.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a rainy city street with a red car and a bus on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars and a bus on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It is following the red car ahead and keeping a safe distance from the bus on the road. The driver is cautious and paying attention to the pedestrians and the traffic lights to avoid any accidents. The braking events or strong decelerations in the driving metadata indicate that the driver is being extra cautious in these conditions."
