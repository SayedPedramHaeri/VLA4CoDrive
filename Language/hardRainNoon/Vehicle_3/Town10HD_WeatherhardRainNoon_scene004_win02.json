  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving slowly on a rainy city street. The car is almost stopped at an intersection, with other cars and pedestrians visible in the background. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are multiple traffic lights and street signs visible throughout the video.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to maintain visibility and avoid potential hazards. The car stops at the intersection to follow traffic rules and ensure the safety of pedestrians and other vehicles. The presence of multiple traffic lights and street signs in the scene emphasizes the importance of following traffic rules and being cautious while driving in adverse weather conditions."
