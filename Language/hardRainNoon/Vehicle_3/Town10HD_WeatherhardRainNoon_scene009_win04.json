  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with a white and blue bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window, likely due to the rainy conditions and the need to maintain safety on the road. The white and blue bus behind the red car is following at a safe distance, and the other cars on the street are also driving cautiously because of the rain."
