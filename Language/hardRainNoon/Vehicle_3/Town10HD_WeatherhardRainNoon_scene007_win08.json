  "title": "Rainy city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving in the rain on a city street, stopping at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "A red car driving on a rainy city street, stopping at an intersection. Other cars are driving in the rain, and there are tall buildings and palm trees on the street. The road is wet, and the visibility is low. There are several traffic lights and a roundabout in the area.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, stopping at an intersection to wait for the traffic light to change. The driver is cautious due to the low visibility and wet road, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The presence of pedestrians and parked cars near the intersection adds to the complexity of the scene, requiring the driver to be extra vigilant."
