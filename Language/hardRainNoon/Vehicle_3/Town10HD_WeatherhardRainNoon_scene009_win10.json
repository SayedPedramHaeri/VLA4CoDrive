  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is important for the driver to maintain a safe distance from the car in front and to be prepared for sudden braking events, as there have been several instances of strong deceleration in this clip. The driver should also be cautious of pedestrians and other obstacles that may be hidden in the rain."
