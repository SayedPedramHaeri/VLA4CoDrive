  "title": "Rainy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with tall buildings on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously in the rain, braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the movements of other cars, adjusting their speed and direction accordingly. The tall buildings on either side of the road create a canyon-like effect, amplifying the sound of the rain and making it difficult to see around corners. Despite the challenging conditions, the driver is able to navigate the city street safely and efficiently."
