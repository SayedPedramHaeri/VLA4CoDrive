  "title": "Rainy city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives in the rain on a busy city street with a white and blue bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a person walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The white and blue bus behind the red car is also driving cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle. The pedestrian on the sidewalk is walking carefully, likely due to the slippery conditions caused by the rain."
