  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street at night, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are many parked cars on the side of the road, and a stop sign is visible in the distance. The street is well-lit with streetlights, and there are no other moving vehicles in sight. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is in a residential area with many parked cars. The frequent braking events are likely due to the car slowing down to navigate the parked cars and the stop sign. The driver is being cautious and following traffic rules to ensure safety."
