  "caption": "Blue car driving on a city street at night, almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night. It is almost stopped at an intersection with a red traffic light. There are other cars on the road, including a parked white truck on the right side of the road. The road is wet and there are tall buildings in the background. The weather is clear and it is nighttime.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is almost stopped at the red traffic light. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The parked white truck on the right side of the road may have obstructed the view of the traffic light, but the driver is still able to see the red light clearly. The wet road indicates that it has recently rained, so the driver needs to be extra careful. The tall buildings in the background suggest that this is a busy city area. The driver is likely waiting for the traffic light to turn green before proceeding."
