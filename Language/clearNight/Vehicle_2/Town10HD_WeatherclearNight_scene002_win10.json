  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night, almost stopped, with 30 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night, almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and street lights illuminating the scene. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on the city street at night, almost stopped. It is likely that the car is approaching a stop sign or a red traffic light. The 30 braking events suggest that the car is navigating through a busy intersection with several other vehicles. The driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any potential collisions or accidents."
