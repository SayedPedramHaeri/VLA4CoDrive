  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a white car. The road is wet and there are traffic lights and street signs visible. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a very slow speed, with multiple instances of braking. This could be due to the presence of other vehicles on the road, or to the wet road conditions. The ego vehicle is likely being cautious to avoid any potential accidents."
