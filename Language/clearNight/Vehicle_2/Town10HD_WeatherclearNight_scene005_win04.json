  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are many parked cars on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are trees on the side of the road. The traffic light is red and there is a stop sign on the corner. The street is dark and there are no other cars on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the frequent braking events. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The wet road and the dark street may have contributed to the frequent braking. The driver is also being careful around the parked cars and the stop sign. The trees on the side of the road and the dark street may have made it difficult to see other cars or pedestrians."
