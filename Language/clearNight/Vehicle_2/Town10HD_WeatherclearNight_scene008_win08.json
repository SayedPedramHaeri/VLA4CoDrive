  "title": "Night city driving with a small blue car on the road.",
  "caption": "The small blue car is driving slowly on a city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is dark and there are tall buildings on either side. The traffic is light and there are a few parked cars on the side of the road. The streetlights are on and the traffic lights are red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because it is night and there is not much traffic. It is also trying to maintain a safe distance from the parked cars on the side of the road. The small blue car is following the traffic rules and is being cautious while driving in the city at night."
