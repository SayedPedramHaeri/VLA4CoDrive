  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night, almost stopped, with 30 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night, almost stopped. There are other cars parked on the side of the road and a red car driving in the opposite direction. The road is wet and there is a tall building in the background. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is almost stopped. The driver is likely reacting to the red traffic light and the pedestrian crossing the street. The wet road and the presence of other cars on the side of the road may also contribute to the cautious driving. The tall building in the background suggests that the car is in a downtown area."
