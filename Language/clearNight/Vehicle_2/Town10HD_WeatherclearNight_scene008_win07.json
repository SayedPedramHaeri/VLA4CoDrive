  "title": "Night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The road is wet, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly down the city street at night. It slows down and stops at the red traffic light. The car then accelerates again when the light turns green. The car also slows down and stops when approaching the pedestrian crossing the street. The car's braking events are likely due to the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The car's sensors detect the braking events and respond accordingly to ensure safe driving."
