  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently green. The road is well-lit by streetlights and there are palm trees lining the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the frequent braking by other cars on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The clear night visibility allows the driver to see the traffic lights and navigate the road safely. The presence of palm trees and well-lit streetlights suggest that this is a city street with moderate traffic."
