  "title": "Night city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night with other cars and a bus on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are other cars on the road, including a red car and a white bus. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are palm trees lining the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is almost stopped. The driver is likely waiting for a traffic signal or for other vehicles to pass. The presence of other cars and the bus on the road suggests that this is a busy city street. The driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any potential accidents."
