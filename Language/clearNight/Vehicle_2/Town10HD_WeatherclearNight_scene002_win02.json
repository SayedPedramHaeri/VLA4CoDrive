  "title": "Clear night city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.6 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The road is well-lit with streetlights and there are tall buildings on either side. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is in a city environment with many other cars on the road. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is congested and the cars are constantly stopping and starting. The driver of the blue car is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it. The presence of tall buildings indicates that this is an urban area with high-density living. The driver needs to be extra vigilant at intersections and watch out for pedestrians and cyclists who may be crossing the street."
