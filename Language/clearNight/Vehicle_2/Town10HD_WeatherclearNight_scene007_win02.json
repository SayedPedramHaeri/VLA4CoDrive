  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white ambulance drives down a curved city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.7 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white ambulance is driving slowly down a curved city street at night. There are other cars parked on the side of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are mostly red and green, and there are several intersections with crosswalks. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The white ambulance is driving slowly down the curved city street at night to ensure safety and avoid any potential accidents. The frequent braking events indicate that the ambulance is navigating through a busy urban environment with many parked cars and pedestrians. The driver must be cautious and attentive to avoid any collisions or delays in reaching the hospital."
