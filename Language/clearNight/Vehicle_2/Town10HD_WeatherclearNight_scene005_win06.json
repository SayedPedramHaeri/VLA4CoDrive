  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving on the road, and a pedestrian is seen crossing the street. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the clear night and the presence of other cars and pedestrians on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the ego vehicle is being cautious and following traffic rules to ensure safety. The parked cars on the side of the road and the pedestrian crossing the street require the ego vehicle to be vigilant and prepared to stop or change lanes as needed."
