  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with 6 braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street at night with moderate speed and 6 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with 2 lanes in each direction. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are driving at a faster speed. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and some parked cars on the side of the road. The ego vehicle is driving straight and changing lanes occasionally.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes when approaching a traffic light or a stop sign. It changes lanes occasionally to avoid congestion or to overtake slower vehicles. The ego vehicle is cautious and maintains a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. It is also prepared to react to any potential risks, such as pedestrians crossing the road or sudden braking from other vehicles. Overall, the ego vehicle is driving safely and responsibly in the city at night."
