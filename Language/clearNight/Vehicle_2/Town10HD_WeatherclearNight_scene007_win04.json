  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with 9 braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving at moderate speeds. The traffic lights are green, and there are no visible stop signs or crossings. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. It slows down or brakes frequently to maintain a safe distance and follow traffic rules. The presence of parked cars and other moving vehicles requires constant attention and careful maneuvering."
