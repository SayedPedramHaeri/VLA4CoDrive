  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street at night, with a moderate speed and 10 braking events or strong decelerations.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.1 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight city street with a moderate amount of traffic. The ego vehicle is driving straight, following a blue car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are changing lanes or turning. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently green. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a moderate speed to ensure safe driving in the city at night. It is following the blue car in front of it and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road to avoid any potential risks. The clear night skies provide good visibility, allowing the driver to see the road and other vehicles clearly."
