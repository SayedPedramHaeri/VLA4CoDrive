  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle on a busy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street at night. There are many other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the left side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety on the busy city street at night. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians. The driver is being cautious and following traffic rules, which is evident from the multiple braking events in the video. The parked truck on the left side of the road and the pedestrian crossing the street are potential obstacles that the driver needs to be aware of to maintain a safe distance and avoid any accidents."
