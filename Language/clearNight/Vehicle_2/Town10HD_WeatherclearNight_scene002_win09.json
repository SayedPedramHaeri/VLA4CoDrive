  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The road is well-lit with streetlights and traffic lights. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly and cautiously due to the clear night conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is likely anticipating the multiple braking events that have occurred in this clip, which may be due to traffic congestion or other factors. The driver is paying close attention to the road and the surrounding environment to ensure safe driving."
