  "title": "Clear night city driving with moderate speed, following a blue car.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night, following a blue car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is dark and wet, with a blue car in front of the ego vehicle. There are other cars parked on the side of the road, and a traffic light ahead. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front, and is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The driver is paying attention to the traffic light ahead, and is ready to make a turn or change lanes if needed. The presence of parked cars on the side of the road requires extra caution to avoid any unexpected movements."
