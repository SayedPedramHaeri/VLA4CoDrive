  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is dark and there are several traffic lights and street lights illuminating the area. The traffic is light and there are a few parked cars on the side of the road. The weather is clear and there is no rain or fog.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly and frequently braking because it is approaching a stop sign. The driver is being cautious and following traffic rules to ensure safety. The braking events are likely due to the stop sign and the need to slow down and come to a complete stop. The driver is also paying attention to other vehicles and pedestrians on the road to avoid any potential accidents."
