  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with clear skies.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on a city street at night, with moderate traffic and clear skies.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.3 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a crosswalk and a traffic light on the right side. There are other cars driving in the same direction, and a parked truck on the left side of the road. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It is keeping a safe distance from the other cars on the road and is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The driver is paying attention to the traffic light and the pedestrian crossing the street, and is ready to react to any potential risks."
