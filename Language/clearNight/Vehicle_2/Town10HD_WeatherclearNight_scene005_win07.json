  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with 7 braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night, with 7 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night, with 7 braking events. The road is dark, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night, with 7 braking events. It is likely that the driver is being cautious due to the darkness and the potential for pedestrians or other vehicles to be less visible. The braking events could be due to the driver noticing obstacles or changes in the road ahead, or they could be part of a training scenario for the autonomous driving system. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians, and it is following all traffic rules and regulations."
