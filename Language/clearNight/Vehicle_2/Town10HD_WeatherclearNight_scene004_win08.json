  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with 9 braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street at night, with 9 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street at night. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are green and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the speed limit and there are other cars on the road. It brakes frequently because there are several pedestrians and cars on the road. The ego vehicle is careful to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. It slows down when approaching intersections and crosswalks to ensure safe navigation. The ego vehicle is also prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as a car suddenly braking or a pedestrian stepping onto the road."
