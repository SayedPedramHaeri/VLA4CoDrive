  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "caption": "A blue and white car drives down a city street at night, with many other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are many other cars driving around, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk nearby. The weather is clear and dark, with some lights from the buildings and cars illuminating the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving very slowly, almost stopped, possibly waiting for a green light or for pedestrians to cross the street. The many braking events suggest that the traffic is quite heavy and requires careful navigation. The driver needs to be vigilant and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as a car suddenly stopping or a pedestrian stepping into the road."
