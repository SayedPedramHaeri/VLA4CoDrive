  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with clear skies.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street at night, with moderate traffic and clear skies.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a center divider. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are driving at moderate speeds while others are parked. There are also a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are several traffic lights along the road, some of which are red and some are green. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and there are no immediate risks.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It is also keeping a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and adjusting the speed accordingly. The clear skies and good visibility make it easier to see potential risks, such as pedestrians or parked cars. The braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is being cautious and prepared to stop at any time."
