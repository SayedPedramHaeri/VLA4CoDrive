  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, and the traffic is quite heavy. The street is well-lit with streetlights and neon signs from the surrounding buildings. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a very slow speed because of the heavy traffic and the multiple braking events. The driver is being very cautious and is constantly monitoring the surroundings for any potential risks. The blue car is following the car in front of it at a safe distance, and it is also preparing to turn left at the next intersection. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk to ensure a safe journey."
