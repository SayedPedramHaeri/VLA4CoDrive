  "title": "Night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "caption": "A small car drives on a city street at night, almost stopped, with 30 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The small car is driving on a city street at night, almost stopped. There are other cars parked on the side of the road and a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The road is wet and there are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The traffic lights are green and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The small car is driving slowly because it is almost stopped. It is likely that the car is waiting for a green light or for pedestrians to cross the street. The wet road and the tall buildings suggest that it has been raining recently. The driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents."
