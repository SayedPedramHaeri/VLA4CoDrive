  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are many other cars driving on the street, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is green, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and dark, with a few streetlights illuminating the road.",
