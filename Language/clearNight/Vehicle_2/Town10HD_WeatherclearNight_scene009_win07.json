  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.1 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down a city street at night. There are several other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic light ahead is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety during the nighttime drive. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and paying attention to the road and other vehicles. The parked truck on the right side of the road may have obstructed the driver's view of upcoming traffic, requiring the driver to brake more frequently. The pedestrian crossing the street also required the driver to slow down and stop to ensure their safety."
