  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with 10 braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a sidewalk and parked cars on the right. There are several cars and a truck driving in the opposite direction. The traffic lights are green, and there are no visible pedestrians. The weather is clear and dark.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious due to the clear night conditions and the presence of other cars. The 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as other cars stopping or slowing down."
