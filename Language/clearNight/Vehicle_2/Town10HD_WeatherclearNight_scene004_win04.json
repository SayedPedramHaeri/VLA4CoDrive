  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and street signs. The weather is clear and there is no traffic on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a very slow speed, almost stopped. It brakes frequently, possibly because of the wet road conditions. The driver is being cautious and driving defensively to avoid any potential accidents. The tall buildings on both sides of the street create a canyon-like effect, which can make it difficult to see oncoming traffic or pedestrians. The driver needs to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe following distance to avoid any collisions."
