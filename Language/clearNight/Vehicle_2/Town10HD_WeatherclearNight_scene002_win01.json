  "title": "Night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "Blue car driving on a city street at night, almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night. It is almost stopped at an intersection with a red traffic light. There are other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the left side of the road. The road is wet and there are tall buildings in the background. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection with a red traffic light. It is almost stopped because it is giving right of way to the car in front of it. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safety. The parked truck on the left side of the road is not obstructing the flow of traffic. The tall buildings in the background add to the urban atmosphere of the scene."
