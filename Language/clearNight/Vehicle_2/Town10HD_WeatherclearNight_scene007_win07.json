  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "caption": "A blue and white car drives down a city street at night, with many other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are many other cars driving down the street, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a crosswalk with a pedestrian walking across the street. The weather is clear and dark, with streetlights illuminating the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down the city street, following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. It slows down or stops at every red traffic light to ensure safety. The blue and white car is careful not to hit any pedestrians crossing the street, and it changes lanes only when it is safe to do so. The ego vehicle's main goal is to reach its destination without any accidents or violations."
