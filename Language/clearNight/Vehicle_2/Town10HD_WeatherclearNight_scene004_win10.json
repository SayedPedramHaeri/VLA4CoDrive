  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a city street at night with moderate speed and 13 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the side and a traffic light at the intersection. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are driving while others are parked. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. The traffic light is green and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is cautious and attentive, paying attention to the traffic light and the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the visibility is good, which helps the driver to see the road and the surroundings clearly. The ego vehicle is driving safely and responsibly, following the rules of the road and the traffic signals."
