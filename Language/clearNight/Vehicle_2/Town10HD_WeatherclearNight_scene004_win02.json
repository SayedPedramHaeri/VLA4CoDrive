  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night, with many other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are many other cars driving on the street, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible at the intersection, and they are all red. The street is well-lit with streetlights and building lights. The weather is clear and there is no rain or fog.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on the city street because it is almost stopped. It is likely that the car is waiting for a green traffic light or for other cars to pass by. The many braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be cautious. The driver should also be aware of the pedestrians crossing the street and the parked cars on the side of the road. Overall, the driver needs to pay attention to the surroundings and follow the traffic rules to ensure safe driving."
