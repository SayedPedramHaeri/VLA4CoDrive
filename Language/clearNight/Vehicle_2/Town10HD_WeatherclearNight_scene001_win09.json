  "title": "Night city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night with almost stopped ego vehicle.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night. There are other cars on the road, including a red car and a white car. The road is wet and there are traffic lights and street signs visible. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a very slow speed, almost stopped, possibly waiting for a traffic light or a pedestrian to cross the street. The other cars on the road are maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle. The wet road suggests that it has recently rained, so the drivers need to be cautious. The traffic lights and street signs provide guidance for the drivers and help them navigate the city streets safely."
