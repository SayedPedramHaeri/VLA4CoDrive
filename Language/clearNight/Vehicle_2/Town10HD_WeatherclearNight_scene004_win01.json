  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night. It is almost stopped and there are frequent braking events. The road is dark and there are tall buildings on both sides. There are also other cars on the road, some of which are parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a very slow speed because of the frequent braking events. The driver is likely trying to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The dark road and tall buildings suggest that it is nighttime and the driver needs to be extra cautious. The presence of other cars on the road also requires the driver to be attentive and prepared to react to any sudden movements or obstacles."
