  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night, almost stopped, with 30 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night, almost stopped. There are other cars parked on the side of the road and a large building in the background. The street is well-lit with streetlights and traffic lights.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a very slow speed, almost stopped, because it is approaching a stop sign. There are 30 braking events in this window, indicating that the car is braking frequently, possibly due to traffic or pedestrians. The car is navigating the city street carefully to avoid any potential risks."
