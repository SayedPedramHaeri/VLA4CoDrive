  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives on a city street at night, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night. It is almost stopped and brakes frequently. There are other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the left side of the street. The road is dark, and the only source of light is the streetlights. The weather is clear, and there are no visible pedestrians or obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a very slow speed, almost stopped, and brakes frequently, possibly because it is approaching a stop sign or a pedestrian crossing. The parked truck on the left side of the street may have obstructed the view of the road ahead, causing the driver to brake more often. The clear night and the dark road may also contribute to the cautious driving behavior of the blue car."
