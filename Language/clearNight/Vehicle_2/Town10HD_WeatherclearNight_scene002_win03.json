  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are green. The road is wet and there are no pedestrians or obstacles visible.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety on the wet road at night. It slows down and brakes when it detects other cars braking ahead to avoid potential collisions. The green traffic lights in the distance indicate that it is safe to continue driving. The absence of pedestrians or obstacles on the road reduces the risk of accidents."
