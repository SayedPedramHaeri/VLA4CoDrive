  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street at moderate speed, with no significant braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street at moderate speed. The road is wet from recent rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The traffic lights are green, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles in sight. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is in a clear night and there is no traffic or pedestrians in sight. It is not braking significantly because the road is wet from recent rain, and the traffic ahead is smooth. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the parked cars on the side of the road, and it is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary."
