  "caption": "Blue car driving on a city street at night, almost stopped at an intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a city street at night. It is almost stopped at an intersection with a red traffic light. There are other cars on the road, including a parked white car on the right side of the road. The road is wet and there are tall buildings in the background. The weather is clear and it is nighttime.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is almost stopped at the red traffic light. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The parked white car on the right side of the road is not moving, so the driver of the blue car is maintaining a safe distance from it. The tall buildings in the background suggest that this is a busy city area. The driver needs to be extra careful at night because visibility is limited and there may be pedestrians or other vehicles that are harder to see."
