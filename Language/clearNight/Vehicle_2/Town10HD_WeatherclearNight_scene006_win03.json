  "title": "Clear night, moderate-speed city driving with a red truck in the left lane.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a city street at moderate speed, with a red truck in the left lane and a bus stop on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a red truck in the left lane and a bus stop on the right. The traffic is moderate, with a few cars in the distance. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the frame.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, maintaining a safe distance from the red truck in the left lane. It is approaching a bus stop on the right, which may require the driver to slow down or stop. The clear night visibility allows for safe driving conditions, but the driver must remain vigilant for any potential risks such as pedestrians or sudden changes in traffic."
