  "title": "Clear night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a city street at moderate speed with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a city street at moderate speed. There are many parked cars on the side of the road. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are many buildings in the background. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is being cautious and attentive to the surroundings to ensure safe driving. The presence of many parked cars on the side of the road suggests that this is a busy area and the driver needs to be extra vigilant. The well-lit street and the visible buildings in the background provide a sense of familiarity and orientation to the driver."
