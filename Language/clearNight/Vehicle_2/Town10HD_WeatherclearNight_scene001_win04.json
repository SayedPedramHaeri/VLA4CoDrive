  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with clear skies.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street at night, with a blue car in the distance and a bus on the opposite side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic is moderate, with a blue car in the distance and a bus on the opposite side. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road, and the ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, with occasional braking events.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front of it and is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The bus on the opposite side is not a threat, but the ego vehicle is cautious of other vehicles and pedestrians that may suddenly appear. The ego vehicle is also aware of the speed limit and is adjusting its speed accordingly. The occasional braking events may be due to other vehicles slowing down or stopping ahead, or they may be caused by the ego vehicle itself slowing down to make a turn or avoid an obstacle."
