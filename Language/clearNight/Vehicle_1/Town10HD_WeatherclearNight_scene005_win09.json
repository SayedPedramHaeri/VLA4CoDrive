  "title": "Clear night, moderate-speed city driving on a straight road with parked cars and traffic lights.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street at moderate speed, passing parked cars and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is straight and has two lanes. There are parked cars on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are green and red. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed because there is no immediate need to stop or change lanes. It keeps a safe distance from the parked cars and prepares to follow the traffic light signals."
