  "title": "Nighttime city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a parked black car. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are palm trees lining the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed and slows down as it approaches an intersection. It then brakes abruptly to avoid a pedestrian crossing the street. The car comes to a complete stop and remains stationary for a few seconds before accelerating again. The driver of the blue car is being cautious and attentive to the surroundings, taking into account the potential risks of nighttime driving in a busy city street."
