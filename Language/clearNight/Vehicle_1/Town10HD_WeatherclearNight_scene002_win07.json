  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with clear skies.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street at night, with moderate traffic and clear skies.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a center divider. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are driving at a moderate speed while others are parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently green. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary, as there are several other cars on the road. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The weather conditions are favorable for driving, but the driver is still cautious and alert to any potential risks."
