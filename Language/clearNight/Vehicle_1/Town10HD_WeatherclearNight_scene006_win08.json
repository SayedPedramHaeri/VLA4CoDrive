  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a dark city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a dark city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently green. The road is wet and there are no pedestrians or obstacles visible.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the dark conditions and the presence of other cars on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars are also slowing down or stopping due to traffic or other obstacles. The driver of the ego vehicle must remain vigilant and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
