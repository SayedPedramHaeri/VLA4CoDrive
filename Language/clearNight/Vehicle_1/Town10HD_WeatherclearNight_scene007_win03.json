  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with 9 braking events",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a city street at night, with 9 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are palm trees lining the road. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is in a city environment with many other cars on the road. The driver is being cautious and braking frequently to avoid collisions. The presence of palm trees and well-lit streetlights suggest that this is a relatively safe area to drive in at night."
