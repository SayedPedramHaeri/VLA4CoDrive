  "title": "Clear night city driving with moderate speed and 4 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a city street at moderate speed, with 4 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.9 m/s). There are 4 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a city street at moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the left side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are several buildings and shops along the street. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is navigating a city street with other cars on the road. The 4 braking events could be due to the need to slow down or stop for pedestrians or other obstacles. The ego vehicle is also following the traffic rules and regulations, and is being cautious and vigilant to ensure safe driving."
