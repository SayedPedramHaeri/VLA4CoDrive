  "title": "Night-time city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a car driving down a city street at night. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a very slow speed because of the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The pedestrian crossing the street is another safety consideration that the driver is paying attention to."
