  "title": "Nighttime city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, and the traffic lights are red. The road is wet, and there are tall buildings on either side of the street. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed and braking frequently due to the heavy traffic on the city street. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the car in front to avoid collisions. The tall buildings on either side of the street create a canyon-like effect, which can make it difficult to see upcoming traffic signals or pedestrians crossing the street. The driver must remain vigilant and be prepared to react quickly to any unexpected events."
