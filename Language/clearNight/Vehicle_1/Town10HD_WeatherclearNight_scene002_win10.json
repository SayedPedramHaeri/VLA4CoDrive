  "caption": "Night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events. The road is wet and there are several cars and a truck on the road. The traffic lights are red and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped and there are 30 braking events in this window. The weather is clear and the road is wet. The traffic lights are red and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle is likely braking to avoid a collision with other vehicles or obstacles."
