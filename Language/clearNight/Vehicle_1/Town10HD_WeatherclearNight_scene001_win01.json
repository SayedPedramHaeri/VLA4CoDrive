  "title": "Clear night city driving with moderate speed and 3 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a city street at moderate speed, with 3 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.7 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a city street at moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are changing lanes. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes when it approaches an intersection or a car in front of it. The ego vehicle is also cautious when passing other vehicles, especially when they are changing lanes. It is important for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from other cars and pedestrians to avoid any accidents. The 3 braking events could be due to the ego vehicle's cautious driving or other vehicles suddenly stopping or changing lanes."
