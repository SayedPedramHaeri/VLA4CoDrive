  "title": "Night city driving, almost stopped at a red light.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a city street at night, with a red light ahead.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are tall buildings on both sides of the road. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is approaching a red light. The driver is likely to stop the car soon to comply with the traffic rules. The presence of other cars on the road and the tall buildings suggest that this is a busy city street. The driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any potential accidents."
