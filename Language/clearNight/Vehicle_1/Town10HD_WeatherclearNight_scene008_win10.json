  "title": "Night-time city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A car drives slowly through a city intersection at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a car driving slowly through a city intersection at night. The road is wet, and there are multiple traffic lights and street signs. The traffic is light, with only a few cars and pedestrians visible. The video captures the car's movements as it slows down and stops at the intersection.",
  "reasoning": "The car is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection with multiple traffic lights. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules, which requires slowing down and stopping when required. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful and paying close attention to the road and other vehicles. This is a safe driving behavior that helps prevent accidents and ensure the safety of all road users."
