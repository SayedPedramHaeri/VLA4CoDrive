  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.3 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and there are many other cars on the street. The traffic lights are green and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The buildings are tall and there are palm trees on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid any accidents due to the wet road and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. It is also prepared to brake or change lanes when necessary to maintain a safe distance from other cars. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the movements of pedestrians to ensure a safe journey."
