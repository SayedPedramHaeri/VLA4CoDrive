  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "caption": "A small car drives down a city street at night, with many parked cars and people on the sidewalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with parked cars on the right side. There are several people walking on the sidewalk, and a few parked cars. The traffic light is red, and there is a roundabout ahead. The weather is clear and dark.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, because it is almost stopped and there are many parked cars and people on the sidewalk. It is important to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians, especially at night. The ego vehicle is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary, and it is paying close attention to the traffic light and the roundabout ahead."
