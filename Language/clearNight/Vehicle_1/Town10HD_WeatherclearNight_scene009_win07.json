  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A black car drives slowly through a city intersection with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The black car is driving slowly through a city intersection at night. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are green. The road is wet and there are tall buildings on either side of the street.",
  "reasoning": "The black car is driving slowly through the intersection because there are multiple braking events happening around it. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The wet road and the tall buildings suggest that it is raining, which could be contributing to the slow driving and the need for extra caution."
