  "title": "Night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "A white car drives on a city street at night, with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are tall buildings on the left side of the street. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights along the street. The white car is approaching an intersection and there is a bus behind it.",
  "reasoning": "The white car is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection and there is a bus behind it. The driver needs to be cautious and pay attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The wet road surface may also require the driver to be more careful to avoid skidding or losing control of the vehicle."
