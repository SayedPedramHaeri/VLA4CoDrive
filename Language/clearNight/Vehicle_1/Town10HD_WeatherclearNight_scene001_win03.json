  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street at night, with a white bus and a parked truck on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a white bus and a parked truck on the side. The traffic is moderate, with a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight at a moderate speed because it is following the flow of traffic. It is keeping a safe distance from the white bus and the parked truck on the side. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and street signs to ensure safe navigation. The braking events or strong decelerations in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is being cautious and prepared to stop or slow down when necessary."
