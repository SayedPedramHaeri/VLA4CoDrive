  "title": "Night-time city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a car driving down a city street at night. The road is wet and there are tall buildings on both sides. The traffic is moderate and there are several other cars on the road. The video shows the car stopping at a red light and then continuing to drive. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a very slow speed because of the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The car stops at the red light and then proceeds when the light turns green. The driver is also keeping a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are not a concern for the driver because they are not crossing the road."
