  "title": "Clear night city driving, almost stopped, 30 braking events",
  "caption": "A silver car drives slowly on a city street at night, with a parked truck on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with parked cars on the right. The traffic is light, with only a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The streetlights are on, and the buildings are lit up. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, possibly due to the clear night conditions and the presence of the parked truck. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the road ahead. The parked truck on the right may also be a factor, as the driver needs to navigate around it. Overall, the scene appears to be a typical city driving scenario at night, with the driver prioritizing safety and careful driving."
