  "title": "Night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "A white car drives on a city street at night, with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic light at the intersection is red.",
  "reasoning": "The white car is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection and the traffic light is red. The car is braking frequently, possibly due to the wet road conditions. The bus behind the white car is maintaining a safe distance, as the road is busy with several other cars driving in the same direction."
