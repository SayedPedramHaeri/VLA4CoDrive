It brakes frequently to avoid collisions and to give way to other road users. The vehicle's sensors detect the distance and speed of the nearby cars and pedestrians, and the driver adjusts the speed and braking accordingly. The roundabout and the traffic lights in the distance are also visible, and the driver follows the traffic rules and signals to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
