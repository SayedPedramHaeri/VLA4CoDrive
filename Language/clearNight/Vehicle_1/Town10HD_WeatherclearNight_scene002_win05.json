  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with clear skies.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street at night, with moderate traffic and a few parked cars on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 4 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a sidewalk on one side and parked cars on the other. There are a few other cars driving in the opposite direction, and a pedestrian crossing the street at a crosswalk. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are a few traffic lights along the road, all showing green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight at a moderate speed, following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. It slows down when approaching the crosswalk, where the pedestrian is crossing the street. The vehicle then accelerates again after the pedestrian has passed. The driver is cautious and attentive, scanning the road for any potential hazards or obstacles."
