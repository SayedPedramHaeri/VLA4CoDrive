  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving in the opposite direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying green lights. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The multiple braking events suggest that the ego vehicle is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as other vehicles stopping or pedestrians crossing the road. The driver of the ego vehicle is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure a safe driving experience."
