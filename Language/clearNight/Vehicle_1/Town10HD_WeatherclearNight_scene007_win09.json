  "title": "Night city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly on a city street at night, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving at moderate speed, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and some parked vehicles blocking the lanes.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection and preparing to stop. There are other cars and pedestrians around, so the driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance. The weather is clear, which helps with visibility, but there are some parked vehicles that could obstruct the view of oncoming traffic. The ego vehicle has been braking frequently, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians."
