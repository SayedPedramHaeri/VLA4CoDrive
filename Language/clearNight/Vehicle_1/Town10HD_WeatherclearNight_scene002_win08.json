  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with 13 braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street at night, with moderate traffic and 13 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.2 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street at night, with moderate traffic and a few parked cars on the side. The road is wet, and there are several traffic lights and street signs visible. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are changing lanes or turning.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and street signs to follow the rules of the road. The 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is being cautious and braking early to avoid potential risks. The driver is also using the car's sensors and the simulation environment to anticipate and react to any potential hazards on the road."
