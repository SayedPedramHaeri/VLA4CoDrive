  "title": "Night city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a city street at night with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, including a bus that is following the red car. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are buildings and shops on either side of the street. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is almost stopped. The bus behind it is following at a safe distance, likely because the road is crowded with other cars. The red car is approaching an intersection where it will need to make a decision about which direction to turn. The driver of the red car needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any potential accidents or collisions."
