  "title": "Night-time city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving down a city street at night. There are many parked cars on the side of the road and a few moving cars in the distance. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are buildings and shops lining the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the road is dry.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a very slow speed because there are many parked cars on the side of the road and the driver needs to be cautious. The multiple braking events suggest that there are other vehicles or pedestrians in the vicinity that the driver needs to be aware of. The driver is likely using the brakes to slow down or stop the car in response to changes in the traffic situation."
