  "title": "Night city driving, almost stopped at a red light.",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a city street at night, almost stopped at a red light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a city street at night. There are other cars on the road, and a red truck is parked on the side of the road. The street is well-lit with streetlights, and there are tall buildings in the background. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because it is almost stopped at a red traffic light. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The presence of other cars on the road and the red truck parked on the side of the road indicate that this is a busy city street. The driver needs to be attentive and prepared to react to any unexpected events or obstacles."
