  "title": "Night city driving, almost stopped at intersection",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly on a city street at night, with a few other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with a few parked cars on the side. There are traffic lights at the intersection, and the pedestrian crossing is visible. The weather is clear and it's nighttime. The ego vehicle is almost stopped and there are 30 braking events in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it's approaching an intersection with a red light. It's also trying to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The pedestrian crossing and the parked cars on the side of the road are visible, so the ego vehicle needs to be cautious and prepared to stop if necessary. The clear night visibility allows the driver to see the road clearly and make safe driving decisions."
