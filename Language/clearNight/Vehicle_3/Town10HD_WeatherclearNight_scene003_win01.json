  "title": "Night city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle.",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a dark city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.2 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a dark city street at night. There are other cars on the road, and the traffic light is green. The road is wet, and there are palm trees and buildings on the sides of the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is almost stopped. The driver is being cautious at night, and there are other cars on the road. The green traffic light indicates that it is safe to proceed. The wet road could be due to recent rain, and the driver needs to be careful of potential hydroplaning. The palm trees and buildings on the sides of the street suggest that this is a city street. The driver needs to pay attention to the pedestrians and other vehicles on the road to ensure safe driving."
