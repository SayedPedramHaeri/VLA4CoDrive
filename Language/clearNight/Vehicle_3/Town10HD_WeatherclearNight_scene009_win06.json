  "title": "Night city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives behind a bus on a city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving behind a bus on a city street at night. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly behind the bus because it is almost stopped. The driver is likely preparing to stop or turn left. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be cautious to avoid collisions. The pedestrian crossing the street is another potential hazard that the driver needs to be aware of."
