  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently green. The road is wet and there are no pedestrians or obstacles visible.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid any potential risks on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that other vehicles are also slowing down or stopping. The driver of the ego vehicle is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars. The wet road conditions may be due to recent rain, which could make the road slippery and increase the risk of accidents. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and following the rules of the road to ensure safe driving."
