  "title": "Clear night city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night with frequent braking. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are all red. There is a tall building on the left side of the road and a large tree on the right side. The street is lined with parked cars and there is a red car parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly at night on a city street with frequent braking. The weather is clear but the road is wet. The ego vehicle is likely braking to avoid collisions with other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are all red, indicating that the ego vehicle should stop. The tall building and large tree on the side of the road are stationary objects and do not pose any immediate danger to the ego vehicle. However, the parked cars on the side of the road and the red car parked on the side of the road could potentially obstruct the ego vehicle's path. Therefore, the ego vehicle should remain vigilant and cautious while driving in this environment."
