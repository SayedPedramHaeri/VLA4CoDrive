  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with clear skies.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on a city street at night with clear skies and moderate speed.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a crosswalk and a traffic light. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is green, and there is a red car parked on the side of the road. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on the city street because the road is clear, and there are no obstacles or pedestrians in the way. The ego vehicle is maintaining a moderate speed because of the clear road ahead and the green traffic light. The ego vehicle is prepared to slow down or stop if needed because of the 7 braking events or strong decelerations in the driving metadata. The ego vehicle is also keeping a safe distance from the other cars on the road to avoid any potential risks."
