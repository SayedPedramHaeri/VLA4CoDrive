  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with clear skies.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street at night, following a red car and passing a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.1 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road, and the street is well-lit with street lamps.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed and follows the red car at a safe distance. It slows down when approaching intersections or when other vehicles are merging into its lane. The driver is cautious and attentive, constantly scanning the road for any potential hazards. The parked truck on the side of the road is an obstacle that the driver needs to be aware of to avoid any sudden maneuvers."
