  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car navigates a busy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The street is well-lit with streetlights and traffic lights. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and requires extra caution. The driver is paying close attention to the road and the surrounding environment to anticipate any potential risks."
