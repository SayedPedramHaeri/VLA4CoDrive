  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with clear skies.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on a city street at night with clear skies and moderate speed.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.3 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. There are several traffic lights and street lights along the road. The traffic is light, with only a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is maintaining a moderate speed and keeping a safe distance from the other cars on the road. It is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary, as there are several traffic lights and pedestrians crossing the street. The driver is also aware of the parked cars on the right side and is cautious not to hit them. The clear skies and good visibility make it easier to see any potential obstacles or hazards on the road."
