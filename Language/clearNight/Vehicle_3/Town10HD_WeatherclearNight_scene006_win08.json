  "caption": "Red car driving slowly on a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are many parked cars on the side of the road. The street is well-lit with streetlights and neon signs from nearby buildings. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is in a city environment with many parked cars on the side of the road. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and paying attention to the surroundings. The driver is likely following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
