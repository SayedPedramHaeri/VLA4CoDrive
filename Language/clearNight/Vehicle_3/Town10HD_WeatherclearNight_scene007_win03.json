  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, and the traffic lights are mostly red. The road is wet, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is in a city environment with many other cars on the road. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the traffic situation. The presence of pedestrians and the wet road surface also require the driver to be extra careful. The red traffic lights indicate that the driver needs to stop or slow down. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and following the traffic rules."
