  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.4 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a city street at night. There are multiple parked cars on the side of the road, and a few other cars driving in the opposite direction. The road is well-lit with streetlights, and there are no pedestrians or other obstacles visible. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down the city street at night, because it is a clear night and the visibility is good. The vehicle is braking frequently, likely due to the presence of parked cars on the side of the road and other cars driving in the opposite direction. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles, and is prepared to stop or change lanes as needed. The driver is being cautious and attentive, scanning the road ahead for any potential risks or hazards."
