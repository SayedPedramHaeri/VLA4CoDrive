  "title": "Clear night city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.9 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down a city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are tall buildings on either side. The weather is clear and there are no visible pedestrians or obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly down the city street at night because there are many other cars on the road that are also braking frequently. This suggests that there may be heavy traffic or an accident ahead. The driver of the ego vehicle is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the cars in front of them. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is constantly stopping and starting, which can be stressful for the driver. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and following the flow of traffic in this busy urban environment."
