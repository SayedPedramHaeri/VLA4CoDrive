  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly on a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are many parked cars on the side of the road. The street is well-lit with streetlights. There are also a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is in a residential area with a speed limit of 25 mph. The frequent braking events are likely due to the presence of pedestrians and parked cars on the side of the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians to avoid any accidents."
