  "title": "Night city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a city street at night with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are several other cars driving on the street. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is almost stopped. The bus behind it is following at a safe distance. The red traffic light indicates that the other cars on the road should also slow down. The pedestrian crossing the street is a potential risk and the ego vehicle should be cautious. The wet road surface may cause slippery conditions and the ego vehicle should maintain a safe following distance."
