  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are green and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and there are several street lights illuminating the road.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because there are multiple braking events ahead. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The tall buildings on both sides of the street create a canyon-like effect, which can make it difficult to see upcoming obstacles or pedestrians. The driver needs to be extra vigilant and pay close attention to the road ahead to avoid any potential accidents."
