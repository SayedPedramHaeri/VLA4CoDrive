  "title": "Clear night city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives behind a bus on a city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.9 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly behind a bus on a city street at night. There are tall buildings on the side of the road and a few parked cars. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and stop signs along the way. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is following the bus at a safe distance, slowing down and braking frequently due to the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The driver is being cautious and attentive to avoid any potential accidents or collisions. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be patient and attentive to navigate through the city safely."
