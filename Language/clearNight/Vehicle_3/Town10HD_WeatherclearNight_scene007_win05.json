  "caption": "Red car drives on a city street at night with other cars and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are other cars on the road, including a red car in front of the ego vehicle. There are also traffic lights and a roundabout. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the frequent braking events. It is also maintaining a safe distance from the red car in front of it. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the roundabout ahead to ensure safe navigation."
