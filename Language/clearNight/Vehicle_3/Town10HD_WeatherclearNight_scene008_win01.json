The driver is being cautious and attentive, scanning the road for any potential hazards or obstacles. The bus and other cars on the road are maintaining a safe distance from the sports car, and the driver is keeping an eye on their movements. The driver is also aware of the parked cars and pedestrians on the side of the road, and is prepared to react to any sudden movements or unexpected events."
