  "title": "Night city driving with almost no speed, many braking events",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly on a dark city street at night, with a motorcycle passing by.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a dark city street at night. There are many parked cars on the side of the road, and a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a motorcycle passing by the red car. The road is wet, and the visibility is low due to the darkness.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because it is approaching a stop sign. There are many parked cars on the side of the road, and the driver needs to be cautious to avoid any potential collisions. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the driver is following the traffic rules by slowing down before reaching the stop sign. The motorcycle passing by the red car is also following the traffic rules by maintaining a safe distance from the red car. Overall, the scene is calm and peaceful, with no signs of aggression or reckless driving."
