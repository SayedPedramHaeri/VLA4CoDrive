  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly through a city intersection with multiple nearby cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.2 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly through a city intersection at night. There are multiple nearby cars and pedestrians. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and stop signs visible. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly through the intersection because there are multiple nearby cars and pedestrians. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being extra careful and paying close attention to the road and the surroundings. The driver is also obeying the traffic lights and stop signs, which helps to ensure safe driving in the city at night."
