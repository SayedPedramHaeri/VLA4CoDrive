  "title": "Night city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives behind a bus on a city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The street is well-lit with streetlights and there are tall buildings on either side. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is almost stopped and there are many other cars on the road. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is congested and the vehicles are trying to maintain safe distances. The bus in front of the red car is also driving slowly, which may be causing the ego vehicle to follow its speed. The driver of the ego vehicle needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any potential accidents in this busy city street at night."
