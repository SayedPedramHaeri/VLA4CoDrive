  "title": "Clear night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly on a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are green and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and there are several street lights illuminating the road.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection with a red traffic light. The driver is braking frequently because there are several other cars on the road and they need to maintain a safe distance. The driver is also cautious because there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and they need to be careful not to hit them. The driver is paying attention to the road and the traffic signals to ensure safe driving."
