  "title": "Nighttime city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving down a city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The street is well-lit with streetlights and neon signs. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving down the city street at a very slow speed because there are many other cars on the road and it needs to brake frequently to avoid collisions. The red light on the car in front of the ego vehicle indicates that the ego vehicle should also slow down and be prepared to stop. The parked cars on the side of the road and the pedestrians walking on the sidewalk add to the complexity of the driving situation, requiring the ego vehicle to be extra cautious."
