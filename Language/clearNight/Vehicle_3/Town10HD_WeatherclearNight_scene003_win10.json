  "title": "Night-time city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a city street at night with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving down a city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, and the street is lined with buildings and streetlights. The weather is clear, and the road is wet. There are several traffic lights and a roundabout in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a very slow speed because of the multiple braking events. The driver is likely reacting to the presence of other vehicles on the road, as well as the need to navigate the roundabout and obey traffic signals. The wet road surface may also be contributing to the need for cautious driving."
