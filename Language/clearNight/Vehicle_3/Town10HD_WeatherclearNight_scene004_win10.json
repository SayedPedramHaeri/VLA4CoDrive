  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving at night with 7 braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on a city street at night with 7 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is straight and has two lanes. There are other cars driving in the same direction, and a red truck is parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are green, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and it's nighttime.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight at a moderate speed because it's following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes when approaching intersections or pedestrian crossings, and it changes lanes carefully to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The driver is cautious and attentive, constantly monitoring the surroundings for any potential risks."
