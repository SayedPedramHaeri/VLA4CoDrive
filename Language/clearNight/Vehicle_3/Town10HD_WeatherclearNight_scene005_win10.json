  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on a city street at moderate speed, with parked cars and trees on both sides.",

  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is in a residential area with parked cars on the side. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the parked cars and trees. There are no immediate risks or obstacles in the scene, so the driver can continue driving straight."
