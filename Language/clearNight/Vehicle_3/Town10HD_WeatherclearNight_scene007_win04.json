  "title": "Clear night, slow city driving with 12 braking events",
  "caption": "Red sports car driving slowly on a city street at night, with other cars and pedestrians nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is a red sports car driving slowly on a city street at night. There are other cars and pedestrians nearby, and the road is well-lit by streetlights. The weather is clear, and there are no obstacles or hazards visible in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is in a city environment with pedestrians and other vehicles nearby. The driver is being cautious and following the speed limit to ensure safety. The 12 braking events or strong decelerations in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is reacting to changes in the traffic situation, such as cars stopping or pedestrians crossing the street. The driver is prioritizing safety and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid collisions."
