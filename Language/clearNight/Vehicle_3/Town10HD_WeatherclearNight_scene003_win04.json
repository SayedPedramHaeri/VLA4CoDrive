  "title": "Clear night city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a city street at night with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The street is well-lit with streetlights and traffic lights. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the drivers are being cautious. The ego vehicle is following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The presence of streetlights and traffic lights indicate that the city has taken measures to ensure safe driving conditions at night."
