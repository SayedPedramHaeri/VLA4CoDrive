  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. A pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility, making it important for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars are also adapting to the reduced visibility. The pedestrian crossing the street at a crosswalk requires the ego vehicle to slow down and stop, ensuring the safety of the pedestrian."
