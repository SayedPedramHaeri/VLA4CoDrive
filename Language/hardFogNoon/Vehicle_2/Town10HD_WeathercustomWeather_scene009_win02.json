  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and a motorcycle rider.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with a blue car driving slowly and a motorcycle rider.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with a blue car driving slowly. There are other cars on the road, and a motorcycle rider is also visible. The road is wet, and there are traffic lights and street signs along the street. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the foggy weather conditions, which reduce visibility and make it difficult to see other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The motorcycle rider is also driving cautiously, maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles. The foggy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road make it important for both the blue car and the motorcycle rider to be extra cautious and vigilant while driving. The frequent braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic is moving slowly and carefully, and the drivers are being extra cautious due to the foggy weather conditions."
