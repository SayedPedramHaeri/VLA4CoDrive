  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a foggy day with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is foggy, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. The pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk, and the parked truck is on the right side of the road. There are several traffic lights along the road, all displaying green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed, following the flow of traffic. It slows down when approaching the pedestrian crossing the street and the parked truck on the right side of the road. The foggy weather reduces visibility, so the ego vehicle keeps a safe distance from other vehicles and objects on the road. The 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window indicate that the ego vehicle is reacting to sudden changes in traffic or road conditions."
