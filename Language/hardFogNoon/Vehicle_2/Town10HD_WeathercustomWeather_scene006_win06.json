  "title": "Foggy city street driving with moderate braking",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with other cars and a pedestrian nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk. The weather is foggy, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy weather, which reduces visibility and makes it harder to anticipate other vehicles' movements. The blue car is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The pedestrian on the sidewalk is not a threat, but the ego vehicle must remain vigilant and cautious while driving in such conditions."
