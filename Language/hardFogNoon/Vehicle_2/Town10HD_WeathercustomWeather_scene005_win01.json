  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 13 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.1 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good. There are no other vehicles on the road except for the parked truck on the right side of the road. The pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are no traffic lights or stop signs in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on the road because there are no obstacles or other vehicles on the road except for the parked truck. The driver is maintaining a moderate speed to ensure safety and avoid any sudden braking or changes in direction. The pedestrian crossing the street is visible, and the driver is cautious and alert to avoid any accidents. The 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window may indicate that the driver is being extra cautious while driving in the city."
