  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a foggy day",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. The traffic is moderate, with a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is foggy, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the immediate vicinity. The pedestrian crossing the street is about 100 meters ahead.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed because the traffic is not heavy and the weather conditions require extra caution. The driver keeps a safe distance from the parked truck and the pedestrian crossing the street, following the general traffic rules. The driver is also prepared to slow down or stop if necessary, given the reduced visibility due to the fog."
