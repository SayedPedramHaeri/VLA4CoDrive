  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle navigates a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.7 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with the ego vehicle moving slowly. There are several other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the road is wet.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is moving slowly due to the foggy conditions, which can reduce visibility and make it harder to anticipate other vehicles' movements. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The parked truck on the right side of the road may also be contributing to the congestion on this particular stretch of the road."
