  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly in foggy city street with multiple parked cars and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. The traffic is almost stopped, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalks. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is low. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the low visibility and the presence of pedestrians on the sidewalks. The vehicle is braking frequently to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the traffic lights and stop signs to avoid any accidents."
