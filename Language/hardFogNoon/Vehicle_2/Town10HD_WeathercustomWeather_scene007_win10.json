  "title": "Ego vehicle almost stopped on a foggy city street with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a center divider. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are moving slowly. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the immediate vicinity. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are blurry and difficult to see.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is almost stopped. The foggy weather and low visibility make it difficult to see other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other cars and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The frequent braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic ahead is congested, and the ego vehicle is navigating through the fog with caution."
