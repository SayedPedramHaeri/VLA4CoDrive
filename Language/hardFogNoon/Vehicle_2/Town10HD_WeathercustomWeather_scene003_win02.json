  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, four-lane city street with a center divider. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is foggy. The ego vehicle is a blue car that slows down and stops at several points along the road due to multiple braking events.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility, making it important for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and objects on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and attentive to the changing traffic conditions. The parked truck on the right side of the road may have contributed to the need for the driver to slow down and stop."
