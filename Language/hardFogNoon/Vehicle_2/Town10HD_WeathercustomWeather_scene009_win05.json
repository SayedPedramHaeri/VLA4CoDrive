  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and a motorcycle rider.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and a motorcycle rider.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopped. A motorcycle rider is visible in the right lane. The road is wet and there are no visible traffic lights or signs. The weather is foggy and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is likely stopping due to the foggy weather conditions, which reduce visibility and make it difficult to see other vehicles and obstacles on the road. The motorcycle rider in the right lane may also be affected by the fog and is likely driving cautiously. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic is moving slowly and carefully, with vehicles maintaining a safe distance from each other to avoid collisions."
