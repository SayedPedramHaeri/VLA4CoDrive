  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with a bus and a truck in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with a bus and a truck in the background. The traffic is almost stopped, with multiple braking events. The weather is foggy, and there are no visible traffic lights or pedestrians. The road is wet, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the foggy weather and the almost stopped traffic. The driver is cautious and maintains a safe distance from the bus and the truck in the background. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested, and the drivers are trying to avoid collisions. The foggy weather and the wet road increase the risk of accidents, so the driver is driving carefully and attentively."
