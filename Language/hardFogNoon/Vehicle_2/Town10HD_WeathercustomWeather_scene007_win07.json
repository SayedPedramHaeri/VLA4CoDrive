  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street with other cars and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. The traffic is light, with the blue car driving slowly and carefully. There are several other cars on the road, some of them parked on the side. Pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalks. The visibility is reduced due to the fog, and the traffic lights are clearly visible.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions, which reduce visibility and make it harder to anticipate other vehicles' movements. The driver is being cautious and following the other cars at a safe distance. The presence of pedestrians on the sidewalks suggests that the driver needs to be extra vigilant and prepared to stop or yield if necessary."
