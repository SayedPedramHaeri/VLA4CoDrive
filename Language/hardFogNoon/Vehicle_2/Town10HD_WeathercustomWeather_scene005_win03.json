  "title": "Foggy city street with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street, stopping at a crosswalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible. The fog is thick, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. The traffic lights are red, and there is a crosswalk in the middle of the street. The ego vehicle is moving slowly, with an average speed of 4.6 m/s. There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility, making it difficult for the ego vehicle to see other vehicles or pedestrians. The red traffic lights and crosswalk require the ego vehicle to stop. The multiple braking events or strong decelerations suggest that the ego vehicle is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. This is a common safety consideration in foggy conditions."
