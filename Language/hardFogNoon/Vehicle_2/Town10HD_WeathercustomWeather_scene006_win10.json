  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a blue car. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. The ego vehicle is moving slowly, with an average speed of 3.3 m/s.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather and the presence of multiple other cars on the road require the ego vehicle to drive cautiously and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars on the road are also driving cautiously due to the foggy weather. The ego vehicle is likely slowing down to avoid any potential accidents."
