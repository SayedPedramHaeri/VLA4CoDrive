  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a clear day, passing a blue car and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and the traffic is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving straight and passing a blue car and a parked truck. There is a traffic light ahead that is currently red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed and keeps a safe distance from the blue car. It slows down as it approaches the red traffic light, preparing to stop. The parked truck on the side of the road does not obstruct the ego vehicle's path."
