  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and a parked truck",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with moderate traffic and a parked truck on the right side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several cars and a truck on the road, all moving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear, and there is no rain or snow.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars. The parked truck on the right side of the road is not obstructing traffic, but it is important to be aware of its presence. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians to ensure safe navigation through the city street."
