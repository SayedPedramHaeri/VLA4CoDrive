  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A purple car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with a speed limit of 30. There are several other cars on the road, all of which are also moving slowly due to the fog. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red. The sidewalks are empty and there are no pedestrians visible in the video.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the fog and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested and the drivers are being cautious. The fog reduces visibility and makes it difficult to see the road ahead, so the ego vehicle is likely driving at a slower speed to ensure safety. The red traffic lights in the distance indicate that the ego vehicle should not attempt to cross the intersection and should wait for the lights to turn green before proceeding."
