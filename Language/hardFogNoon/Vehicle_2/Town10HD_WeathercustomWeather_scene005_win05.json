  "title": "Foggy city street with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, stopping at a stop sign.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are multiple parked cars on the side of the road. The traffic is light, with only a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The stop sign is clearly visible on the right side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility, so the ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the road. The stop sign is a clear indication for the driver to stop and check for any oncoming traffic before proceeding."
