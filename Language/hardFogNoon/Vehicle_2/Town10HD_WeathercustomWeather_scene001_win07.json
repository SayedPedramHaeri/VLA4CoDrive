  "title": "Foggy city street with moderate traffic, the ego vehicle is almost stopped.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are moving slowly while others are stationary. A bus is visible in the distance, and there is a traffic light on the right side of the road. The weather is clear, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars. The traffic light on the right side of the road is currently red, which is why some of the vehicles are stationary. The bus in the distance is not a concern for the ego vehicle at the moment, but it is important to be aware of its presence in case it changes lanes or makes a turn."
