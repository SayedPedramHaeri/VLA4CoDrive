  "title": "Foggy city street with slow-moving traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible. The fog is thick, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. The red car is moving at a slow pace, with an average speed of 1.3 m/s. There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather conditions likely contribute to the slow-moving traffic and the need for frequent braking. The driver of the red car must be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid potential accidents. The lack of other visible vehicles or pedestrians suggests that the driver may be driving in a less populated area of the city."
