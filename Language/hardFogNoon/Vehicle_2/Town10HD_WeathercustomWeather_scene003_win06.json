  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the scene. The ego vehicle is moving slowly, with an average speed of 2.8 m/s. There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather and the multiple braking events suggest that the driver is exercising caution while driving. The low visibility may require the driver to slow down and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The absence of traffic lights or stop signs also means that the driver needs to rely on their own judgment and the behavior of other vehicles to navigate the road safely."
