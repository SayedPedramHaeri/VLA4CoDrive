  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a clear day, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and the traffic is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving straight and passing a parked truck on the right side of the road. There is a pedestrian crossing the street on the left side of the road. The traffic light is red and the stop sign is on the right side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight at a moderate speed because the road is wet and there is no immediate need to stop or change lanes. The parked truck and the pedestrian crossing the street are visible in the ego vehicle's field of view, but they do not pose any immediate danger. The red traffic light and the stop sign on the right side of the road indicate that the ego vehicle should continue driving straight and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles."
