  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with two lanes. There are several other cars on the road, all moving slowly due to the fog. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, but they are not very clear. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. There are no pedestrians or obstacles visible in this scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the low visibility caused by the fog. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that other cars on the road are also adapting their driving behavior to the foggy conditions. Overall, the scene is a typical example of driving in foggy weather, where drivers need to be extra cautious and attentive to avoid accidents."
