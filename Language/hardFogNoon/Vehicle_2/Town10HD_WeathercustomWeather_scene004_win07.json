  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.7 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and there are other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are red.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The wet road surface may also be a contributing factor to the braking events."
