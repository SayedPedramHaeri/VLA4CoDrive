  "title": "Slow city driving with heavy braking, clear weather",
  "caption": "A small blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with heavy braking and a car following.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.9 m/s). There are 27 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a white car and a parked blue car. The weather is clear, but there is fog in the air. There are no pedestrians or traffic lights visible in this clip.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because there is heavy traffic ahead. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The parked blue car on the side of the road is an obstacle that the ego vehicle must navigate around. The foggy weather reduces visibility, making it important for the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles."
