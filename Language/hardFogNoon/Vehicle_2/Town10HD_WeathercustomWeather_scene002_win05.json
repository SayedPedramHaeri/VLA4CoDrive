  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 3 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.3 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, but there is fog in the distance. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying green lights. The pedestrian crossing the street is wearing a black jacket and is walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on the road because there are no obstacles or other vehicles that require it to change lanes or slow down. However, it is important for the driver to be cautious of the pedestrian crossing the street and to maintain a safe distance from the parked truck in case it opens its doors or turns into the road. The braking events may be due to other vehicles on the road or traffic congestion ahead."
