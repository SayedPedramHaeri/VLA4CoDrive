  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.1 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a white car and a parked blue car. The weather is foggy, and there are multiple traffic lights and street signs visible. The video shows the ego vehicle braking frequently, with a total of 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather and the presence of multiple other cars on the road require the ego vehicle to drive cautiously and brake frequently to avoid potential accidents. The parked blue car on the side of the road may have obstructed the view of the white car, leading to the need for the ego vehicle to brake more often. The multiple traffic lights and street signs visible in the video suggest that the ego vehicle is navigating a complex urban environment with many rules and regulations to follow."
