  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a foggy day with 9 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, four-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. The traffic situation is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The weather is clear, and the visibility is moderate due to the fog.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety and avoid any sudden braking or changes in direction. It keeps a safe distance from the parked truck and other vehicles on the road. The driver is attentive to the traffic light and adjusts the speed accordingly. The foggy weather requires extra caution and slower speeds to avoid any accidents."
