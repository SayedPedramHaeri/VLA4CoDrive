  "title": "Foggy city street driving with 12 braking events",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle driving slowly and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also changing lanes. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red. The weather is clear, but the fog reduces visibility. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the other cars.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility and requires the ego vehicle to drive cautiously. The driver is constantly scanning the road ahead and adjusting the speed and lane position accordingly. The frequent braking events indicate that the other cars on the road are also driving cautiously due to the fog. The driver is following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles to avoid any accidents."
