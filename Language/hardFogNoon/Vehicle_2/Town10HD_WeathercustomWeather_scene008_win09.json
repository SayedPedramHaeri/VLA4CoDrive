  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and a motorcycle rider.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and a motorcycle rider.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopped. A motorcycle rider is visible on the right side of the road. The road itself is wet and there are several traffic lights and street signs visible in the background. The weather is foggy and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because of the foggy weather conditions, which reduce visibility and make it difficult to see other vehicles and obstacles on the road. The motorcycle rider on the right side of the road is likely also affected by the fog and is moving cautiously. The presence of several other cars on the road suggests that traffic is heavy and drivers need to be extra careful to avoid accidents. The wet road surface may also be slippery, which could lead to skidding or loss of control if drivers are not careful."
