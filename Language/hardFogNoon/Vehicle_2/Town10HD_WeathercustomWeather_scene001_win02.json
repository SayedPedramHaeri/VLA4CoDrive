  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a foggy day with 10 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.1 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. The traffic is moderate, with a parked truck on the right side of the road and a pedestrian crossing the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is clear. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on the foggy city street, maintaining a safe distance from the parked truck on the right side of the road. As the pedestrian crosses the street, the ego vehicle slows down to ensure their safety. The traffic lights in the distance are visible, and the ego vehicle is prepared to stop if necessary. The weather is clear, but the fog reduces visibility, so the ego vehicle must remain vigilant and cautious while driving."
