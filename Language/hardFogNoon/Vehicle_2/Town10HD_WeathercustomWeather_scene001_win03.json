  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a foggy day with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "A person on a bike rides across a crosswalk in front of a car on a foggy day.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.3 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with 4 lanes and a crosswalk. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and there are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The weather is foggy and visibility is low. There is a pedestrian crossing the street and a parked truck on the side of the road. The traffic light is red and there is a stop sign on the corner.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and slows down as it approaches the crosswalk. It stops and waits for the pedestrian to cross the street. Then, it accelerates again and continues driving. The foggy weather reduces visibility and the driver needs to be extra cautious. The braking events could be due to the driver anticipating pedestrians or other vehicles on the road. The parked truck on the side of the road could also be a potential obstacle for the ego vehicle to be aware of."
