  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.6 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and there are other cars on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The pedestrian crossing the street is another safety consideration that the driver is aware of."
