  "title": "Foggy city street driving with 9 braking events",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle driving slowly and stopping frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopping frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red. The road is wet and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is foggy and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on the foggy city street because of the low visibility and frequent braking events. The driver is being cautious and following the other cars on the road. The frequent braking events are likely due to the foggy weather and the need to stop frequently to avoid collisions. The driver is also paying attention to the pedestrians on the sidewalk and the traffic lights in the distance to ensure safe driving."
