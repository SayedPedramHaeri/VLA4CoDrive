  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a foggy day with 6 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. The traffic situation is moderate, with several cars and a truck parked on the side. The weather is foggy, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. The traffic light is red, and the parked truck is blocking the right lane. The ego vehicle slows down and stops at the red light.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safe driving in the foggy conditions. It slows down and stops at the red traffic light to avoid potential collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The parked truck in the right lane forces the ego vehicle to change lanes, which it does cautiously to avoid any sudden movements from the truck. The foggy weather requires the ego vehicle to be extra vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
