  "title": "Almost stopped in a foggy city street, with a blue car and a bus nearby.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with a blue car and a bus nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped in the middle of the road. There is a blue car to the left and a bus to the right. The road is foggy and there are no other visible vehicles or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is likely stopping due to the presence of the blue car and the bus. The foggy weather may also require extra caution while driving. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the blue car and the bus to avoid any potential collisions."
