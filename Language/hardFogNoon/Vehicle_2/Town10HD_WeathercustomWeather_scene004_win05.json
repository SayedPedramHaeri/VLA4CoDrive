  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street with other cars and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. The traffic is light, with a blue car driving slowly and carefully. There are other cars parked or moving slowly in the opposite direction. Pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalks. The visibility is reduced due to the fog, and the streetlights provide some illumination.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions, which reduce visibility and make it harder to judge distances. The driver is being cautious and following the other cars at a safe distance. The pedestrians on the sidewalks are also affected by the fog, as they may be harder to see for the drivers. The foggy conditions require extra attention and care from all road users to ensure safety."
