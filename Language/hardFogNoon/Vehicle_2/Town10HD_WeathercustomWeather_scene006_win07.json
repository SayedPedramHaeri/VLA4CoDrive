  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.7 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a 4-lane city street with a center divider. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a parked silver car. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. The road is wet, possibly from recent rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the low visibility caused by the fog. The multiple braking events could be caused by the reduced visibility, as well as the presence of other vehicles on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and is prepared to stop if necessary. The driver is being cautious and attentive to avoid any potential accidents in these challenging conditions."
