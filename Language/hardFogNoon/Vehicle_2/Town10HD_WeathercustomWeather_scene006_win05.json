  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day, with 6 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a foggy city street, following a blue car and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from recent rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the blue car in front of it. It changes lanes to pass the parked cars on the side of the street. The driver is cautious and brakes early to avoid any potential risks. The pedestrian crossing the street is visible, and the driver slows down to ensure safety. The foggy conditions require extra attention to the road and other vehicles."
