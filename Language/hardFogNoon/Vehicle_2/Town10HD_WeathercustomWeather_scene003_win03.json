  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly through a foggy city intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly through a foggy city intersection. There are multiple traffic lights and a crosswalk. The road is wet and visibility is low due to the fog. The traffic situation is moderate with other cars driving in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the intersection because of the low visibility caused by the fog. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful and is prepared to stop at any moment. The crosswalk and traffic lights are important safety considerations for the driver to pay attention to."
