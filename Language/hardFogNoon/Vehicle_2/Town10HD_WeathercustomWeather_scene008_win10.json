  "title": "Almost stopped in a foggy city street with a blue car in the distance.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a foggy city street with a motorcycle rider.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with a blue car in the distance. The traffic is light, and there are no pedestrians or obstacles visible. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is moderate. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window. This suggests that the traffic is heavy, and the vehicles are braking frequently. The blue car in the distance is driving at a moderate speed, and the motorcycle rider is keeping a safe distance from the other vehicles. The foggy weather conditions may be causing the drivers to be more cautious and drive at slower speeds to ensure safety."
