  "title": "Foggy city street with moderate traffic, the ego vehicle is almost stopped.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are moving slowly while others are stationary. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green signals. The weather is clear, and there are no visible pedestrians or obstacles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions, which reduce visibility and increase the risk of accidents. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is congested, and the driver is constantly adjusting the speed to avoid collisions. The green traffic lights suggest that the driver is following the traffic rules and regulations, and the overall driving behavior is safe and responsible."
