  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a clear day, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight city street with 4 lanes and a sidewalk on the right. There are several parked cars on the right side of the road. The traffic is moderate, with a blue car driving in front of the ego vehicle. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good. There are several traffic lights along the road, all showing green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed and keeps a safe distance from the blue car in front of it. It slows down when approaching the parked truck and the pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary, taking into account the potential risks of the braking events or strong decelerations in the driving metadata."
