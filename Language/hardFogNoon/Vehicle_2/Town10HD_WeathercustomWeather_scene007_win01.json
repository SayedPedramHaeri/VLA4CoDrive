  "title": "Foggy city street with slow-moving traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a center divider. There are several other cars on the road, all moving slowly due to the foggy weather. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, but they are not very clear. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. There are no pedestrians or other obstacles visible in the video.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the low visibility caused by the fog. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that other cars on the road are also adjusting their speed and distance due to the foggy weather. The foggy weather and the slow-moving traffic create a challenging driving environment that requires extra caution and attention from the driver."
