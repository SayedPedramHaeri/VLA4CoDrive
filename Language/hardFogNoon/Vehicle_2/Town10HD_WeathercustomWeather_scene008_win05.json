  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white van drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white van is driving slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events. There are other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The road is wet and there are traffic lights and stop signs visible. The weather is foggy and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The white van is driving slowly due to the foggy weather conditions, which reduce visibility and make it harder to see other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The van brakes frequently, likely in response to other vehicles or obstacles on the road. The parked truck on the right side of the road may also be contributing to the reduced visibility and the need for the van to brake frequently. Overall, the van is driving cautiously to ensure safety in these challenging conditions."
