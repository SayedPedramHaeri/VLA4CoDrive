  "title": "Slow city driving with 21 braking events in a 10-second clip.",
  "caption": "A small car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with a bus and other cars in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with two lanes. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and follows a blue car. There are several other cars parked or driving on the street. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the low visibility and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front. The 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as cars stopping or slowing down unexpectedly."
