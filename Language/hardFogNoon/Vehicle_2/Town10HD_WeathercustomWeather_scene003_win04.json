  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are showing green. The weather is clear, but the fog reduces visibility. There is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the other cars. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safety."
