  "title": "Foggy city street driving with 18 braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and foggy, with a blue car driving slowly. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and the video was taken during the day.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly due to the foggy conditions, and it brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The pedestrian crossing the street is another potential hazard that the driver needs to be cautious of. The foggy conditions reduce visibility, making it important for the driver to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to be prepared for sudden braking or changes in direction."
