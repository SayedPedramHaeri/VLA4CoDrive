  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red. The road is wet and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the drivers are being cautious. The pedestrian crossing the street is another safety consideration that the ego vehicle driver needs to be aware of. The red traffic lights in the distance indicate that the ego vehicle should also be prepared to stop soon."
