  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopped. Pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalks. The road is wet, and there are traffic lights and street signs visible in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather and the stopped traffic suggest that the ego vehicle is driving cautiously to avoid any accidents. The pedestrians on the sidewalks indicate that this is a busy urban area with people going about their daily routines. The wet road surface may be due to recent rain, which could also explain the fog. The ego vehicle's almost stopped state suggests that it is giving way to other vehicles or waiting for a safe opportunity to proceed."
