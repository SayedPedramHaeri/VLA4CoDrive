  "title": "Foggy city street driving with 10 braking events",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with other cars and a pedestrian nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. The traffic is light, with a few cars in the distance. The fog is thick, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the immediate vicinity. The weather is clear, but the fog is dense.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the fog and the presence of other cars on the road. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles and is prepared to brake if necessary. The pedestrian near the crosswalk is not a concern at the moment, but the ego vehicle is aware of their presence. The 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the traffic ahead is slowing down, possibly due to fog or other weather-related factors."
