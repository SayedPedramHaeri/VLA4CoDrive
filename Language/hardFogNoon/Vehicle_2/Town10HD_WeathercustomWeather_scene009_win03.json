  "title": "Almost stopped in a foggy city street with multiple cars and a motorcycle.",
  "caption": "A blue car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with other cars and a motorcycle.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are multiple cars and a motorcycle on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because it is almost stopped. The foggy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road require the driver to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The driver is also paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the street and the red traffic light, which indicates that they need to stop. The multiple braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the traffic ahead is slowing down or stopping, which requires the driver to react accordingly to maintain safety on the road."
