  "title": "Foggy city street driving with 14 braking events",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with a car driving slowly and stopping frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 5.0 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with a car driving slowly and stopping frequently. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing green. The video was taken during the daytime.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather and the slow speed of the car suggest that the driver is being cautious. The frequent braking events indicate that there may be a lot of traffic or pedestrians on the road. The driver needs to be attentive and prepared to stop at any moment to ensure safety."
