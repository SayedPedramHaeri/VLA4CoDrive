  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly in a foggy city street, with a bus and a truck in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a white van. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. There are multiple traffic lights and a roundabout in the scene. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently, with an average speed of almost 0 m/s.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather and the presence of multiple vehicles on the road require the ego vehicle to drive cautiously and brake frequently to avoid collisions. The driver must pay close attention to the traffic lights and other road users to ensure safe navigation through the city street."
