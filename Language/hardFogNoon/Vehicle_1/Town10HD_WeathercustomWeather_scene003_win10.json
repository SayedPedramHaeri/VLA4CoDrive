  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a foggy city street with other cars and pedestrians on sidewalks.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a sidewalk on the right side. There are several cars and a parked truck on the left side of the road. The traffic lights are red, and there is a roundabout ahead. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. The video shows the ego vehicle driving slowly and carefully through the foggy city street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the low visibility and the presence of other cars and pedestrians on the sidewalks. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is congested and moving slowly. The driver of the ego vehicle must be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid collisions. The parked truck on the left side of the road may also pose a risk if it moves into the traffic lane."
