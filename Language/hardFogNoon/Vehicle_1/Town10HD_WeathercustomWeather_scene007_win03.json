  "title": "Foggy city street driving with 9 braking events",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle driving slowly and stopping frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopping frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red. The road is wet and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is foggy and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on the foggy city street because of the low visibility and the frequent stopping of other vehicles. The driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the traffic lights and pedestrians. The braking events are likely due to the slow and stop-start nature of driving in these conditions. The driver is also maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any potential collisions."
