  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a sidewalk on the right. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians in sight. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the scene. The parked truck is on the right side of the road, and the pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk.",

It is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary, especially if there are any sudden changes in the traffic situation. The driver is focused on the road ahead and is constantly scanning for any potential risks or obstacles."
