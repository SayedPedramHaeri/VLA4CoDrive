  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with a bus and a truck in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.7 m/s). There are 16 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and foggy, with a white car driving slowly in the left lane. There is a bus and a truck in the background. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The pedestrian crossing the street adds an additional element of caution, as the driver needs to be aware of potential pedestrians in the area."
