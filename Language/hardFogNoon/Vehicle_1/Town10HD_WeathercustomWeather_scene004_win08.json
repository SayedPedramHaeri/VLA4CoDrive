  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a red truck and a green traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, passing a red truck on the left side and a green traffic light on the right side. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles in sight. The weather is clear, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety while driving on a clear day. It slows down when approaching the red truck and the green traffic light, following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The foggy atmosphere may require extra caution while driving, as visibility could be reduced in case of sudden changes in weather conditions."
