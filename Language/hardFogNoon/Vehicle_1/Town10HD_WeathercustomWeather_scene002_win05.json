  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 4 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 4 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, but there is fog in the distance. The pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk, and the parked truck is on the right side of the road. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight at a moderate speed because it is following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The driver is paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the street and the parked truck on the right side of the road. The 4 braking events or strong decelerations may be due to other vehicles stopping suddenly or the driver slowing down to follow traffic rules."
