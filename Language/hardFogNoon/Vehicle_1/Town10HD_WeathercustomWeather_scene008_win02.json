  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white van drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.7 m/s). There are 22 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white van is driving slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events. There are other cars on the road, and a pedestrian can be seen on the sidewalk. The road is wet, and there are no visible traffic lights or stop signs.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The pedestrian on the sidewalk is also a potential safety concern, and the driver needs to be vigilant to avoid any accidents."
