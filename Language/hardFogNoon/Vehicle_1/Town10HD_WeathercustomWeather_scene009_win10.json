  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A police car drives slowly through a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.8 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The police car is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the left side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet. The police car slows down and stops at an intersection before proceeding.",
  "reasoning": "The police car is driving slowly through the foggy city due to the reduced visibility. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the road and other vehicles. The parked truck on the left side of the road may have obstructed the driver's view momentarily, leading to the need to brake. The driver is likely prioritizing safety and following traffic rules to avoid any accidents in these challenging conditions."
