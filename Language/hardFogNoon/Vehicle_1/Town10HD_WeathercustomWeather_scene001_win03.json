  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a foggy day with 14 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy day, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, four-lane city street with a speed limit of 40 km/h. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is foggy, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. The pedestrian crossing the street is wearing a yellow jacket and is walking on the sidewalk. The parked truck is on the right side of the road, and there is a traffic light at the intersection up ahead.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed because of the foggy weather conditions, which reduce visibility and make it harder to anticipate upcoming traffic or pedestrians. The driver is cautious and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles, especially when approaching the intersection with the traffic light. The driver also slows down when passing the pedestrian crossing the street, ensuring their safety. The parked truck on the right side of the road does not obstruct the ego vehicle's path, but the driver remains vigilant for any unexpected movements from other vehicles or pedestrians."
