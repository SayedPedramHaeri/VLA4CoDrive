  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 5 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is low due to the fog. There are other cars on the road, and a traffic light is visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the low visibility caused by the fog. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The wet road surface may also be contributing to the cautious driving behavior."
