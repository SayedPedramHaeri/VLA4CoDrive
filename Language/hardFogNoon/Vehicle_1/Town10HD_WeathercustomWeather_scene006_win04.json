  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 9 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a pedestrian and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a pedestrian crossing and a parked truck on the right side. The weather is clear, and there are no traffic lights or stop signs visible. The pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk, and the parked truck is stationary. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and brakes slightly as it passes the pedestrian and the parked truck.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety and avoid any sudden braking or lane changes. It slows down slightly when passing the pedestrian and the parked truck, following the general rule of giving priority to pedestrians and stationary vehicles. The clear weather conditions allow for better visibility and easier navigation, reducing the risk of accidents."
