  "caption": "A car drives down a foggy city street with two braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The car is driving down a foggy city street with two braking events. The road is wet and there are other cars on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The car is driving at a moderate speed because the weather is foggy and visibility is low. The driver is being cautious and braking early to avoid any potential accidents. The car is changing lanes to get into the right lane for the upcoming intersection. The driver is paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the street and the red traffic light."
