  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are multiple traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The weather is clear, and the road is wet.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the fog and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The fog reduces visibility, and the driver needs to be extra vigilant to avoid any accidents. The multiple braking events could be due to other vehicles stopping or slowing down suddenly, or it could be the result of the driver being extra cautious in the foggy conditions."
