  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. A pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility, making it necessary for the ego vehicle to drive slowly and carefully. The multiple braking events suggest that the other cars on the road are also adapting to the reduced visibility. The pedestrian crossing the street at the crosswalk is another potential hazard that the ego vehicle needs to be aware of."
