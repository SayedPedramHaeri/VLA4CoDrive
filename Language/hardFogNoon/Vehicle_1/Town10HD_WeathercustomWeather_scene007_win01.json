  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle driving slowly and braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic light ahead is red, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, but the fog is thick, reducing visibility.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and braking frequently to avoid any potential accidents. The pedestrian crossing the street and the red traffic light ahead are also factors that the driver is taking into consideration while driving."
