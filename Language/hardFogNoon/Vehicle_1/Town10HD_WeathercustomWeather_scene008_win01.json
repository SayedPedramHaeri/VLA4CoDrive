  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and pedestrians on the sidewalk.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with moderate traffic and pedestrians on the sidewalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several cars and a motorcycle driving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The traffic is moderate, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear, and there are no traffic lights or stop signs visible in the video.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions, which reduce visibility. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are also visible, and the driver is being mindful of their presence. The braking events or strong decelerations in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is being extra cautious and is prepared to stop at any moment if necessary."
