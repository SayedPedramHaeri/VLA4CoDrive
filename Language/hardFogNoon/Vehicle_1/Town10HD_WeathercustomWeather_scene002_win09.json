  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.5 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are two cars in front of the ego vehicle, one of which is braking frequently. There is also a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the foggy conditions and the frequent braking events by the car in front. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles and is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary. The presence of the parked truck on the right side of the road adds an additional element of caution to the driving situation."
