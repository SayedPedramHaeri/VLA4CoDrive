  "title": "Foggy city street with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with a blue car driving slowly and stopping at a red light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are multiple cars driving in the opposite direction, and a blue car is driving slowly and stopping at a red light. The visibility is low due to the fog, and the traffic light is clearly visible.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping at a red light to ensure safety. The foggy conditions make it difficult to see other vehicles and pedestrians, so the driver must be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other cars. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is being extra cautious in these conditions."
