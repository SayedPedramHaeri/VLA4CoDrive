  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and a bus following.",
  "caption": "A white bus follows a small white car on a foggy city street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. The traffic is light, with a few cars and a bus moving slowly. The white car in front of the ego vehicle is almost stopped, and the white bus behind it is following at a moderate distance. There are no pedestrians or obstacles visible in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, maintaining a safe distance from the white car in front of it. The white bus behind the white car is following at a similar speed, but with more distance between the vehicles. The foggy weather conditions may require the drivers to be extra cautious and vigilant for any potential hazards or obstacles on the road. The frequent braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic is moving slowly and carefully in these conditions."
