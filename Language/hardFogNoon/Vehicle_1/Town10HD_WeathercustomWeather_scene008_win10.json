  "title": "Almost stopped in a foggy city street intersection",
  "caption": "A car is almost stopped at a foggy city street intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The car is driving slowly on a foggy city street intersection. There are other cars and a pedestrian nearby. The traffic light is red.",
  "reasoning": "The car is almost stopped because it is at a red light. There are other cars and a pedestrian nearby, so the car needs to be cautious. The weather is foggy, which reduces visibility. The car is braking frequently, possibly because of the fog and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians."
