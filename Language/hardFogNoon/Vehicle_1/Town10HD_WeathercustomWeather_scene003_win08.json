  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. There are other cars on the road, and a red truck is parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is wet. The fog is thick, and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The white car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The parked red truck on the side of the road may have contributed to the braking events, as the driver had to slow down to avoid a collision. The foggy conditions and the wet road make it difficult to see the traffic lights and other obstacles clearly, so the driver is relying on the sensors and the braking system of the car to navigate safely through the traffic."
