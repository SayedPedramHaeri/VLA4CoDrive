  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 17 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple traffic lights and other cars on the road. The road is wet and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and there is no rain or snow.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the fog and the presence of other cars and pedestrians on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be cautious. The white car is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles and adjusting its speed according to the traffic conditions."
