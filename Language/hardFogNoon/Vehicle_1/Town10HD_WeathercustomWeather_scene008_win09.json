  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and pedestrians at crosswalk.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and pedestrians crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also stopped. A pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk, and there is a traffic light visible in the distance. The road is wet, and the visibility is low due to the fog.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of pedestrians at the crosswalk. The vehicle is braking frequently to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of it. The driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the traffic light and the pedestrians to ensure a safe passage through the intersection."
