  "title": "Foggy city street with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the scene. The ego vehicle is moving slowly, and there are six braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather and the multiple braking events suggest that the ego vehicle is driving cautiously to avoid any potential accidents. The low visibility makes it difficult to see other vehicles or pedestrians, so the driver is maintaining a safe distance from other objects on the road. The slow speed and the braking events indicate that the driver is being very careful and attentive to the road conditions."
