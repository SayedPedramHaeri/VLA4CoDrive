  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are several other cars on the road, all driving slowly due to the fog. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing at the next intersection. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully due to the fog and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The pedestrian crossing at the next intersection is a potential risk, and the ego vehicle must remain vigilant to ensure safe passage."
