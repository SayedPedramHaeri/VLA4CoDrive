  "title": "Foggy city street with slow-moving traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.4 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several other cars on the road, all moving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently green. The weather is clear, but the fog reduces visibility to about 50 meters.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested and that the other vehicles are also driving cautiously. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and is prepared to brake if necessary. The foggy conditions require extra caution and slower speeds to ensure safety."
