  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.9 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple traffic lights and parked cars on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are other cars driving in the distance. The weather is clear and there are no pedestrians or obstacles visible.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The parked cars on the side of the road and the traffic lights are important cues for the driver to navigate the road safely. The driver is also paying attention to the weather conditions and adjusting their speed accordingly."
