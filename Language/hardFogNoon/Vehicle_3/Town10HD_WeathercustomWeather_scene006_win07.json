  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day, with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, four-lane city street with a center divider. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. There are also a few parked cars on the side of the road. The weather is clear, but there is fog in the distance. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and the ego vehicle passes through a green light. The pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk and crossing the road at designated crosswalks.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. It slows down when approaching intersections or pedestrian crossings. The driver is attentive to the traffic signals and adjusts the speed accordingly. The fog in the distance could reduce visibility, so the driver needs to be extra cautious and alert to any potential hazards."
