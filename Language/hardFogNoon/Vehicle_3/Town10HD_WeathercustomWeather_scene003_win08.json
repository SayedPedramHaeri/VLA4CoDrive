  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several other cars on the road, all moving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear, and there is no rain or snow.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested, and the drivers are trying to maintain a safe distance between each other. The pedestrian crossing the street is another safety consideration that the ego vehicle driver needs to be aware of."
