  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives in foggy conditions on a busy city street with a white bus and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The white bus is driving in the opposite direction. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road. The pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk, and some are crossing the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The foggy weather and low visibility make it challenging for the drivers to see the road ahead and react to potential hazards. The drivers need to be extra cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid collisions. The presence of multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road helps to regulate the traffic flow and ensure the safety of all road users."
