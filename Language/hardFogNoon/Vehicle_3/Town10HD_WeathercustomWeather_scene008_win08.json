  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and a motorcycle passing by.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped and a motorcycle passing by.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with the ego vehicle almost stopped. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also stopped. A red car is driving in the opposite direction. There is a motorcycle passing by on the right side of the road. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights along the road. The visibility is low due to the fog.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The motorcycle passing by on the right side of the road is an example of how different vehicles can navigate the same road under different conditions. The presence of several traffic lights along the road indicates that this is a busy intersection and the driver needs to be extra cautious while driving."
