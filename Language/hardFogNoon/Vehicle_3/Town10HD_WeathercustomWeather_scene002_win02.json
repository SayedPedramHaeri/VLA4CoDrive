  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.2 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are several other cars on the road, all moving slowly due to the fog. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing at the next intersection. The weather is foggy, and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the fog is causing visibility issues, and the driver is taking extra precautions to avoid accidents. The pedestrian crossing at the next intersection is another potential hazard that the driver needs to be aware of."
