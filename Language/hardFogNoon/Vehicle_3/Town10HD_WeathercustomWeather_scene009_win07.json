  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives in front of a bus on a foggy day.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.9 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and foggy, with a red car driving in front of a bus. There are several other cars on the road, and a pedestrian can be seen on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is curved with a roundabout at the end of the street.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility, and the ego vehicle must be cautious while driving. The red car in front of the bus is braking frequently, which causes the ego vehicle to slow down and maintain a safe distance. The pedestrian on the sidewalk is also a potential hazard, and the ego vehicle must be prepared to react if the pedestrian steps onto the road. Overall, the ego vehicle must navigate the foggy and busy city streets with caution and attentiveness."
