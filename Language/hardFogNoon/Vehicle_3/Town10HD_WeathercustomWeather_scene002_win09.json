  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a red car and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.1 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, passing a red car on the left side and a parked truck on the right side. There are no pedestrians or traffic lights in the scene. The weather is clear, and there are no visible obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety while driving on a clear day. It slows down when approaching the red car and the parked truck, maintaining a safe distance from both. The foggy atmosphere may reduce visibility, but the ego vehicle's sensors help it detect and react to any potential obstacles or hazards."
