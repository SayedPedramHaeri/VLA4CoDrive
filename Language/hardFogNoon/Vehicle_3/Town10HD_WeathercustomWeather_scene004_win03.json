  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a foggy atmosphere. There are several other cars on the road, all moving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are no pedestrians or obstacles in the scene. The weather is clear, and there is no rain or other adverse conditions.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions, which reduce visibility and make it difficult to anticipate other vehicles' movements. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested, and the drivers are likely reacting to sudden changes in the flow of traffic. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary."
