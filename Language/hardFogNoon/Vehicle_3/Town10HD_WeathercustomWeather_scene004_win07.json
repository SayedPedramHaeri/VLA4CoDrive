  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple traffic lights and parked cars on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are other cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the fog and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the road ahead. The parked cars on the side of the road may also be contributing to the driver's cautious driving behavior."
