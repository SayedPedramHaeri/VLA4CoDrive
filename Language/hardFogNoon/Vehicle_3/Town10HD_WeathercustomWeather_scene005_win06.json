  "title": "Slow city driving on a clear day, with 20 instances of braking or strong deceleration.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a foggy city street, with a stop sign on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly down a foggy city street, with a stop sign on the right. There are several other cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road is wet from recent rain, and there are trees and buildings lining the street.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly down the foggy city street because of the low visibility caused by the fog. The driver is being cautious and paying close attention to the road and the surroundings. The stop sign on the right indicates that the driver needs to be prepared to stop if necessary. The presence of parked cars and pedestrians on the sidewalk suggests that the driver needs to be aware of other road users and maintain a safe distance from them. The wet road surface may also require the driver to adjust their speed and braking to avoid hydroplaning. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the conditions of the road and the weather."
