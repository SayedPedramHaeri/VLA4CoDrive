  "title": "Foggy city street with moderate traffic and frequent braking",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with moderate traffic and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 5.0 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 km/h. The traffic is moderate, with several cars in the distance and a red car parked on the right side of the street. The weather is foggy, reducing visibility to about 50 meters. There are several traffic lights along the road, all displaying green lights. The ego vehicle is moving slowly, with an average speed of 5.0 m/s and frequent braking events.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility and requires the ego vehicle to drive cautiously. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being extra cautious, possibly due to the reduced visibility. The presence of other vehicles on the road also requires the driver to maintain a safe distance and be prepared for sudden braking or changes in direction. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the conditions of the foggy city street."
