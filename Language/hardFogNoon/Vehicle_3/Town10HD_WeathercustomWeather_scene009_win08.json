  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white bus follows a red car on a foggy city street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and foggy, with a white bus following a red car. There are several other cars on the road, and a pedestrian can be seen on the sidewalk. The traffic light is red, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather reduces visibility, and the ego vehicle slows down to maintain a safe distance from the red car in front. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the pedestrian on the sidewalk adds to the complexity of the scene. The white bus follows the red car, maintaining a safe distance, and the parked truck on the side of the road could be an obstacle for other vehicles."
