  "title": "Foggy city street driving with frequent braking",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple traffic lights and parked cars on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are other cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and there are no visible pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the foggy conditions and the frequent braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of multiple traffic lights and parked cars on the side of the road suggests that this is a busy urban area with a high density of traffic. The driver needs to be extra vigilant and attentive to avoid any potential accidents or collisions."
