  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple traffic lights and parked cars on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are other cars driving in the distance. The weather is clear and there are no pedestrians or obstacles visible.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of multiple traffic lights and parked cars on the side of the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation or to obstacles that are not visible in the video."
