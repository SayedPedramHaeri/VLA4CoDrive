  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and there are other cars on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The red traffic light and the pedestrian crossing the street are potential risks that the driver is aware of and is prepared to react to."
