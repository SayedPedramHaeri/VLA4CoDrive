  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple traffic lights and other cars on the road. The road is wet and visibility is low due to the fog. The traffic lights are mostly red, and there are parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The fog reduces visibility, making it difficult to see pedestrians or obstacles ahead. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and adjusting their speed accordingly."
