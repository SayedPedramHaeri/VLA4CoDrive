  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, but the fog makes it difficult to see further than that. The road is wet, possibly due to recent rain.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather conditions and the high number of braking events suggest that the drivers are being extra cautious. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and is prepared to brake if necessary. The frequent braking events could be due to the reduced visibility caused by the fog. The drivers are likely taking extra precautions to avoid any potential accidents."
