  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple other cars and pedestrians visible. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and stop signs visible. The weather is foggy and visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the foggy weather and the presence of multiple other cars and pedestrians on the road. The driver is being cautious and braking frequently to avoid any potential accidents. The foggy weather and the wet road surface increase the risk of collisions, so the driver is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is being very cautious and is likely reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation."
