  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are several other cars on the road, all moving slowly due to the fog. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are no pedestrians or obstacles visible. The weather is foggy, and visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions, especially in the foggy conditions. The driver is cautious and attentive, constantly scanning the road ahead for any potential hazards."
