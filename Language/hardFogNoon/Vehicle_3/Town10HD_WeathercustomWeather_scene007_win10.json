  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",

  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with palm trees and other cars. The road is wet and there is fog in the air. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The ego vehicle is almost stopped and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the presence of other cars and pedestrians on the street. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules to ensure safety. The red traffic light and the pedestrian crossing the street are also influencing the driver's decision to slow down and stop."
