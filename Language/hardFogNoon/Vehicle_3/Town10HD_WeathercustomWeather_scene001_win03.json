  "title": "Foggy city street with multiple braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street. There are two other cars driving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, one of which is braking frequently. There is also a parked truck on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently red. The weather is foggy, reducing visibility.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The frequent braking events from the other cars may be due to the foggy weather conditions, which can reduce visibility and make it harder to anticipate upcoming traffic. The ego vehicle should remain vigilant and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
