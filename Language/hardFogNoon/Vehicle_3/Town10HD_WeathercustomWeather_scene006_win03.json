  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a red bus on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. There are no other vehicles in sight, but a red bus is visible on the right side of the road. The weather is clear, but there is a light fog that reduces visibility to about 100 meters. The traffic lights are all green, and there are no pedestrians or obstacles in the immediate vicinity.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, maintaining a safe distance from the red bus on the right. The driver is alert and attentive, scanning the road ahead for any potential hazards. The clear weather and lack of traffic make this a relatively easy drive, but the driver must still remain vigilant and prepared to react to any unexpected events."
