  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and there are other cars on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious due to the low visibility and wet road conditions. The red traffic light and the parked truck on the side of the road are also contributing to the driver's cautious driving behavior."
