  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a parked truck and a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight, two-lane city street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic is moderate, with a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, but there is fog in the distance. The pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk, and the parked truck is on the right side of the road. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in this section of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, maintaining a safe distance from the parked truck and the pedestrian. It is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary, as indicated by the presence of the pedestrian and the parked truck. The fog in the distance may require the driver to be extra cautious and alert for any potential hazards."
