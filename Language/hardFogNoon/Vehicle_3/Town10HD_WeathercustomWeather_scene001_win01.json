  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and there are other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are red. There is a large truck parked on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly because of the foggy conditions and the multiple braking events. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The fog reduces visibility and the driver needs to be extra vigilant to avoid any accidents. The large truck parked on the side of the road could also be a potential obstacle for the other vehicles on the road."
