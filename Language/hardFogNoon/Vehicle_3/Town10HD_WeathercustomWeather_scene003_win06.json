  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a foggy day with 7 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a foggy city street, passing a red car and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a straight city street with a foggy atmosphere. The traffic situation is moderate, with a few cars driving in the same direction. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The traffic light is visible in the distance, and the red car passes by on the right side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety in the foggy conditions. It slows down or brakes when necessary to avoid potential risks. The driver is cautious and attentive to the traffic situation, adjusting the speed and distance to the front car accordingly. The presence of the red car and the traffic light in the distance highlights the importance of being aware of other vehicles and traffic signals while driving in foggy conditions."
