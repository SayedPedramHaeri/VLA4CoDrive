  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.8 m/s). There are 22 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street, with multiple braking events. The road is wet and there are other cars on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a parked truck on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy weather and the multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents. The red light indicates that the driver is following traffic rules and regulations. The parked truck on the side of the road may have obstructed the driver's view of upcoming traffic, adding to the need for caution."
