  "title": "Ego vehicle almost stopped in clear weather, with 30 braking events in the last second.",
  "caption": "A red car drives in front of a bus on a foggy day.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving in front of a bus on a foggy day. The road is wet and there are no other cars on the road. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped because it is following the red car in front of it. The foggy weather reduces visibility and the wet road may require extra caution. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance from the car in front of it and be prepared for any sudden movements or braking."
