  "title": "Foggy city street with almost stopped traffic and a red car in the distance.",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a foggy city street with other cars and a red truck parked on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with a red car driving in the distance. There are other cars on the road, and a red truck is parked on the side. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is low. There are traffic lights and a crosswalk in the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The foggy weather and low visibility make it difficult for the ego vehicle to see far ahead. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any accidents."
