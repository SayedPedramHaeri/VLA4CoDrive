  "title": "Foggy city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.8 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street. There are multiple braking events or strong decelerations in this window. The road is wet and visibility is low due to the fog. There are other cars on the road, and a pedestrian can be seen on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving slowly on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The driver is likely being cautious due to the low visibility and wet road conditions. The braking events could be caused by other cars on the road or pedestrians crossing the street. The driver needs to be attentive and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
