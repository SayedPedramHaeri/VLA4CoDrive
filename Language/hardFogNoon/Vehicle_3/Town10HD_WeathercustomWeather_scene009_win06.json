  "title": "Foggy city driving with almost stopped ego vehicle.",
  "caption": "A red car drives in front of a white bus in foggy conditions.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a foggy city street with a red car driving in front of a white bus. The road is wet and there are several other cars and pedestrians in the scene. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and the weather is clear. The ego vehicle is almost stopped and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The foggy conditions and the almost stopped ego vehicle suggest that the driver is being cautious and following the traffic closely. The presence of other cars and pedestrians in the scene highlights the importance of attentive driving in such conditions. The driver may be preparing to stop or change lanes, as there are several other vehicles in the vicinity."
