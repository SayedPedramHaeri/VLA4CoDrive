  "title": "Foggy city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a foggy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (customWeather). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.2 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and there are other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving on a foggy city street with multiple braking events. The driver is likely reacting to the heavy fog and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The red traffic lights in the distance suggest that the driver is approaching an intersection and needs to stop. The driver is likely using the brakes to slow down and come to a stop safely."
