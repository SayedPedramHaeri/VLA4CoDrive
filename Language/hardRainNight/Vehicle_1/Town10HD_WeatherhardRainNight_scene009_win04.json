  "caption": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing. The road is wet and slippery. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also slowing down. A pedestrian is crossing the street at a crosswalk. The traffic lights are green for the ego vehicle.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the street. The braking events are likely due to the slippery road surface. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
