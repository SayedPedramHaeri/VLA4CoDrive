  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are driving at a slower speed. There is a traffic light ahead that is currently red. The sidewalks are lit up with street lamps.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet and visibility is reduced. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The ego vehicle is approaching a red traffic light and will likely slow down or stop soon. The driver is being cautious and attentive to avoid any potential risks."
