  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city with many other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a car in front of it. There are many other cars and pedestrians on the road, and the traffic lights are mostly red. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver is cautious and attentive, constantly scanning the road ahead for any potential hazards. The rain and low visibility make it challenging to see and react to obstacles, so the driver must remain vigilant at all times."
