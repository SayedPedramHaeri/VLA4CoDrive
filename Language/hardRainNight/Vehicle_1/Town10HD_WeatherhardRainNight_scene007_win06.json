  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A rainy night in a city with the ego vehicle stopping and slowing down frequently due to traffic and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The road is wet, and there are multiple other cars and pedestrians around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is foggy. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The wet road and reduced visibility due to fog make the driving conditions more challenging. The ego vehicle is stopping and slowing down frequently to avoid collisions with other cars and pedestrians. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is being extra cautious in these conditions. The presence of traffic lights in the distance suggests that the driver is following traffic rules and regulations to ensure safe driving."
