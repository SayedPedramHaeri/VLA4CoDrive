  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the left side of the road. The weather is dark and rainy, with the headlights of the cars illuminating the road ahead.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy conditions, which can make the road slippery and reduce visibility. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the cars ahead. The presence of other cars and the tall building suggest that this is a busy city street, and the driver needs to be alert and prepared for any sudden changes in traffic or pedestrians."
