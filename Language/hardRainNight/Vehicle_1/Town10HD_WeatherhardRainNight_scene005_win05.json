  "title": "Rainy night city street driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes when approaching intersections or pedestrian crossings. The driver is cautious and pays close attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The rainy weather requires extra vigilance to avoid potential accidents."
