  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving slowly on a rainy city street at night. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking frequently. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are traffic lights and street signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The white car is driving slowly because of the rainy and wet road conditions. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic ahead is stopping frequently, possibly due to the low visibility. The car is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it to avoid collisions. The driver is being cautious and driving defensively to ensure safety."
