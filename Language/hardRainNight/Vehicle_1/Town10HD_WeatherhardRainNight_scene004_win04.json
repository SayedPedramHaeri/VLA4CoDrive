  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A white van drives down a rainy city street at night, with the ego vehicle almost stopped and braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is low. The white van is driving down the left side of the street, and there are other cars parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the street. The rain is falling heavily, and the headlights of the vehicles are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions, and it frequently brakes to avoid potential hazards. The white van in front of the ego vehicle is also driving slowly, which causes the ego vehicle to slow down and brake frequently. The parked cars on the side of the road and the large building on the right side of the street create a sense of a busy city at night."
