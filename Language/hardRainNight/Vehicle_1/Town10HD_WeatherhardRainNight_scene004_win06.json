  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white van drives down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.9 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white van is driving slowly down a rainy city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are several traffic lights and street signs visible along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver must remain vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other cars to prevent accidents. The rain reduces visibility and makes it harder to anticipate the movements of other vehicles, so the driver must rely on the traffic lights and street signs to navigate safely."
