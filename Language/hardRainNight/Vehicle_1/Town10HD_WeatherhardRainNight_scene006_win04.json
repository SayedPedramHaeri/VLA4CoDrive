  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed and multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A car driving on a rainy night on a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The car is driving on a rainy night on a city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying red and green lights. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are also visible and seem to be walking slowly. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night on a city street with multiple braking events. The weather conditions require the driver to be extra cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The braking events could be due to the reduced visibility and wet road surface. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and pedestrians on the sidewalk to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
