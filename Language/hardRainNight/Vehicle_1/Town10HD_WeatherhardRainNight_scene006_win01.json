  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a bus and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. The traffic is moderate, with other cars driving in the same direction and a bus parked on the side of the road. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road, and the rain creates a reflective sheen on the pavement.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It keeps a safe distance from other vehicles and adjusts its speed when approaching traffic lights or intersections. The driver is cautious and attentive, scanning the road for any potential hazards or obstacles."
