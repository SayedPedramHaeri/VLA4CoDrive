  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city street with a blue car in the foreground.",
  "caption": "A blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with other cars and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and the visibility is low. The traffic is light and the other cars are driving at a moderate speed. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road. The blue car is driving carefully and slowly, following the other cars.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, which can affect visibility and road traction. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The presence of traffic lights and street signs indicate that the driver is following the traffic rules and regulations. The blue car is driving carefully and slowly, following the other cars and adapting to the traffic situation."
