  "caption": "A rainy night city street driving with moderate speed and occasional braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night city street with moderate speed. There are other cars on the road, some of them are driving straight while others are turning left. The road is wet and there are traffic lights and street signs along the way. The weather is rainy and visibility is limited.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet and slippery. It is braking occasionally to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and attentive to avoid any potential risks. The rainy weather conditions require extra attention to traffic lights and road signs to ensure safe driving."
