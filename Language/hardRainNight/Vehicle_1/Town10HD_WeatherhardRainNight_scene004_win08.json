  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A car driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a car driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying green and red lights. The sidewalks are crowded with pedestrians and there are parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed on a rainy night in a city. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions. The presence of other cars on the road and the pedestrians on the sidewalks require the driver to be alert and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation. The green and red traffic lights provide guidance on when to stop or go, and the parked cars on the side of the road require the driver to be careful not to hit them. Overall, the driver needs to exercise extra caution and be aware of the potential risks in this rainy night city driving scenario."
