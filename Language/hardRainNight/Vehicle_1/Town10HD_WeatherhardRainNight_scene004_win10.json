  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A car driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The car is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed and frequent braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are red. The sidewalks are lit up with street lamps and there are people walking on the sidewalks. The rain is falling heavily and the windshield wipers are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet and visibility is reduced. The frequent braking is likely due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other cars on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the cars in front of it and is prepared to brake if necessary. The rainy weather and the presence of pedestrians on the sidewalks require the driver to be extra cautious and attentive."
