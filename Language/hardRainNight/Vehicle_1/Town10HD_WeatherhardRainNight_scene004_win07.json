  "caption": "A white van drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a red bus and a parked truck on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.1 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the street, including a red bus and a parked truck. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the streetlights provide some illumination. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes frequently to avoid potential risks, such as the parked truck on the side of the road. The driver is cautious and attentive to the traffic situation, adjusting the speed and distance to other vehicles accordingly."
