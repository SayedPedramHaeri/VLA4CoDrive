  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a parked truck on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the street, some of them are driving at a slower speed. A traffic light is visible in the distance, and it is currently red. The sidewalks are illuminated by streetlights, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalks. The ego vehicle is driving in the right lane.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It keeps a safe distance from the parked truck on the right and other cars on the street. The driver is cautious and attentive to the traffic light and pedestrians on the sidewalks. The rainy weather conditions require the driver to be extra vigilant and adapt their driving behavior accordingly."
