  "title": "Rainy night city driving with a bus and a red car on the road.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with a bus and a red car on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and the visibility is low. The traffic is light and the other vehicles are driving slowly. There are several traffic lights and street lights illuminating the street. The rain is falling heavily and the windshield wipers are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It is keeping a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road, especially the bus and the red car. The ego vehicle is also paying attention to the traffic lights and adjusting its speed accordingly. The rain is making the road slippery and reducing visibility, so the ego vehicle is being extra cautious and alert."
