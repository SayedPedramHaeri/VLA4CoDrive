  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A car driving slowly in the rain on a busy city street with many other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a car driving slowly on a rainy night in a busy city street. There are many other cars and pedestrians around. The road is wet and visibility is low. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are red. The video also shows a tall building in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and foggy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is reacting to sudden changes in the traffic situation, such as pedestrians crossing the street or other cars stopping abruptly. The driver is prioritizing safety and following the traffic rules to avoid any accidents."
