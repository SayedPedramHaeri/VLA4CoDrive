  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.5 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The weather is dark and rainy, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rainy and dark conditions, which reduce visibility and increase the risk of accidents. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the ego vehicle is trying to maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The large building on the right side of the road may also be a source of distraction for the driver, as it is a prominent feature in the environment."
