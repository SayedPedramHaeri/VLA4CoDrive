  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with an ambulance on the road.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle on a rainy night in a city with an ambulance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night in a city with an ambulance on the road. The road is wet and slippery, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is moving slowly, and there are several other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck and a car driving in the opposite direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the streetlights provide some illumination.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of the ambulance suggests that there may be an emergency situation ahead, and the driver needs to be extra vigilant. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and streetlights to navigate safely through the city."
