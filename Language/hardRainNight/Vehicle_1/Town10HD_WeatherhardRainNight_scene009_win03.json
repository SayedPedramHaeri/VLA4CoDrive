  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic light is red, and there is a person walking on the sidewalk. The video shows the ego vehicle braking frequently, with an average speed of almost 0 m/s.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events are likely caused by the need to stop and slow down to avoid potential accidents. The rain reduces visibility and makes it harder to anticipate the movements of other road users, so the ego vehicle is taking extra precautions to ensure safety."
