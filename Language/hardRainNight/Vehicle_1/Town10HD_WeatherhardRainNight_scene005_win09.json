  "caption": "A rainy night city street driving, moderate speed, no significant braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night city street. There are other cars on the road, some of them are driving straight while others are turning left. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are green. The road is wet and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and there is no significant braking observed in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night city street. The rain is making the road slippery and the visibility is low. The driver is maintaining a moderate speed and keeping a safe distance from other vehicles. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are green, indicating that the ego vehicle can continue driving straight. The driver is paying attention to the road and the traffic situation, ready to react to any potential risks."
