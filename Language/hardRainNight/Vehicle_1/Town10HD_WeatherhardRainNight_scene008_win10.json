  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "caption": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped at intersection. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are several cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are red and there is a crosswalk nearby. The pedestrians are wearing dark clothing and are walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully on the rainy city street. It is approaching an intersection and is about to stop. The driver is being cautious due to the low visibility and wet road conditions. The braking events and strong decelerations indicate that the driver is being extra careful to avoid any accidents. The parked truck on the right side of the road and the crosswalk nearby are also factors that the driver is taking into consideration while driving."
