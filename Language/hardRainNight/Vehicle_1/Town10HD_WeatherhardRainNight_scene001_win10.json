  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white bus drives down a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the street, including a red car and a parked truck. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the streetlights provide some illumination. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and that the other drivers are also being cautious. The ego vehicle needs to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead to avoid collisions."
