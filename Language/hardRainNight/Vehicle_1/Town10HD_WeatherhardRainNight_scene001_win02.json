  "caption": "A white bus drives on a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars and a bus driving on it. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the street is illuminated by the headlights of the vehicles. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety on the wet road. It slows down and brakes when approaching intersections or other vehicles to avoid collisions. The rainy weather conditions require extra caution and attentiveness to the surroundings."
