  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. Some of them are also braking, possibly due to the rainy conditions. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are currently green, allowing the ego vehicle to continue driving. There are also some pedestrians on the sidewalk, but they are not crossing the street at the moment.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It is also braking frequently to avoid potential accidents caused by the rainy conditions. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians to ensure safe driving. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and prioritizing safety over speed."
