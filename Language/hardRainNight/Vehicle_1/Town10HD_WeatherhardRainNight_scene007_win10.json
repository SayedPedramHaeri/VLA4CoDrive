  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street at night, with rain and multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The visibility is moderate, and the weather is rainy.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other vehicles that are also braking frequently. The driver is cautious and attentive to the traffic lights and pedestrians, ensuring a safe driving experience."
