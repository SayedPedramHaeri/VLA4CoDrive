  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A white car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a parked truck on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is low. The traffic is light, with only a few cars and pedestrians around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing green. The parked truck is blocking one lane, and the white car is driving slowly to avoid any accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rain and the low visibility. It brakes frequently to avoid any potential collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The parked truck on the side of the road adds to the complexity of the driving situation, as it reduces the number of available lanes. The green traffic lights in the distance indicate that the ego vehicle can continue driving at its current speed, but it should remain vigilant and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
