  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A white van drives down a rainy city street at night, with a silver car following it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The white van is driving slowly, and the silver car is following it closely. There are other cars on the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rainy and dark conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid potential accidents and to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of it. The parked cars on the side of the road and the pedestrians on the sidewalk also require the driver to be extra vigilant and cautious."
