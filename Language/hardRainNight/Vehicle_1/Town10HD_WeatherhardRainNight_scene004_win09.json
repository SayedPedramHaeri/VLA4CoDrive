  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed and 4 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed and 4 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.9 m/s). There are 4 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is dark and rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving straight and changing lanes.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy weather conditions. It is changing lanes to avoid the parked truck on the side of the road. The 4 braking events are likely due to the slippery road surface caused by the rain. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road to avoid any potential accidents."
