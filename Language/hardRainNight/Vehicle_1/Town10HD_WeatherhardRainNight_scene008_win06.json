  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A police car drives down a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The police car is driving slowly and carefully, with its headlights on. There are other cars on the road, and some of them are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing red lights.",
  "reasoning": "The police car is driving cautiously because of the rain and the low visibility. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the surrounding traffic to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
