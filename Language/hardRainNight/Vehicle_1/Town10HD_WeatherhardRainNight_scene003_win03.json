  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the street. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety on the wet road. It slows down or brakes when it detects other vehicles braking ahead, possibly to avoid collisions. The rainy weather conditions make it harder to see the road and other vehicles, so the ego vehicle needs to be extra cautious. It is important for the driver to keep a safe distance from other vehicles and adjust its speed according to the road and traffic conditions."
