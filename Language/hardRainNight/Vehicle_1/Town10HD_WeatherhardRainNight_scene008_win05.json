  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and many other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.8 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a car in front of it. There are many other cars on the road, some of them are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all red. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are few and far away, and they are not doing anything unusual.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the low visibility. It is following the car in front of it at a safe distance, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic is congested and unpredictable, so the ego vehicle needs to be extra cautious and attentive. The tall buildings on both sides of the road create a canyon effect that amplifies the rain's impact on visibility, so the ego vehicle needs to rely more on its sensors and less on its eyes. Overall, this is a challenging driving scenario that requires a high level of situational awareness and defensive driving skills."
