  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly down a rainy city street. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly down the rainy city street because of the hardRainNight weather conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be cautious. The driver is likely following a car in front of them and preparing to stop at the next traffic light. The wet road surface increases the braking distance and requires the driver to be more attentive to avoid any accidents."
