  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously, with 15 instances of braking or strong deceleration.",
  "caption": "A slow-motion video of a rainy night drive in a city with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.1 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving slowly and cautiously on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are several other vehicles on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the ego vehicle is following the traffic rules. The video captures the raindrops hitting the windshield and the sound of the wipers can be heard in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The driver is being extra careful due to the wet road conditions and reduced visibility. The 15 instances of braking or strong deceleration suggest that the driver is being very cautious and is likely reacting to the rainy conditions. The driver is also following the traffic rules and is keeping a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. Overall, the video shows the importance of driving carefully and being aware of the road conditions during rainy nights."
