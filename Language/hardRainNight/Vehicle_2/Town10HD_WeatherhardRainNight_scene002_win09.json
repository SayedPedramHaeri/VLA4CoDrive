  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with many other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously, following a black car in front of it. There are many other cars and pedestrians on the street, and some of them are also braking or stopping. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing red or green lights. The buildings and streetlights are illuminated by the rainy weather, creating a moody atmosphere.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather and the presence of many other vehicles and pedestrians on the street. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the traffic situation is quite dynamic and requires constant attention from the driver. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and adjusting the speed accordingly. Overall, this video shows the challenges and risks of driving in a busy city street during a rainy night."
