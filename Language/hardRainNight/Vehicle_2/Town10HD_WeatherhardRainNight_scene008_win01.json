  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue and white van drives slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The van is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying green and red lights. The sidewalks are wet and there are a few pedestrians walking on them. The weather is rainy and the rain is falling heavily.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The braking events or strong decelerations in the driving metadata indicate that the driver is reacting to the traffic situation and adjusting the speed accordingly. The driver is also being mindful of the pedestrians on the sidewalks and making sure to give them enough space. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging weather conditions."
