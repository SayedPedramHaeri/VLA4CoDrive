  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.7 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is dark and rainy, which affects visibility.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down or brakes when approaching intersections or pedestrian crossings. The driver is cautious and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid potential accidents. The rainy weather requires extra attention to traffic lights and pedestrians to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
