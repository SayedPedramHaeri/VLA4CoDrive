  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city, with other cars and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red. The rain is falling heavily, and the headlights of the cars illuminate the road ahead.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other cars on the road. The driver must be cautious and attentive to the traffic signals and pedestrians who may be crossing the street. The rainy weather requires the driver to adjust their speed and following distance to ensure safe driving."
