  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a busy city street with tall buildings and many other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The traffic is heavy, with many cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are green, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalks. The rain is falling heavily, and the headlights of the cars illuminate the wet road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other cars or pedestrians. The driver must be cautious and attentive to the surroundings to navigate the busy city street safely."
