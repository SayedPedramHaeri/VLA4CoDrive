  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are multiple traffic lights and stop signs. The weather is rainy and dark.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid potential risks and to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events indicate that the traffic is heavy and the road is slippery. The car's headlights and wipers are on to improve visibility and safety."
