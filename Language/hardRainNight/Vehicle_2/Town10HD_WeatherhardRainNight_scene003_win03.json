  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are green and the pedestrians are mostly staying on the sidewalk. The ego vehicle is following the car in front of it and changing lanes to avoid obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events. The weather conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road require the driver to be cautious and attentive. The driver is using the brakes frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the car in front. The driver is also changing lanes to avoid obstacles and improve the visibility of the road ahead. The presence of pedestrians on the sidewalk and the green traffic lights indicate that the driver needs to be aware of the surroundings and follow the traffic rules to ensure the safety of everyone on the road."
