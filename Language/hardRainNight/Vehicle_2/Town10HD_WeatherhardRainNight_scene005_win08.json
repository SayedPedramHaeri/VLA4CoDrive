  "title": "Rainy night city street driving with moderate speed and occasional braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with other cars and pedestrians visible.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few parked cars on the side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced. The ego vehicle is driving carefully and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It slows down or brakes when approaching intersections or other vehicles to avoid potential collisions. The driver is cautious and attentive, constantly scanning the environment for any potential hazards. The rainy weather conditions require extra attention to ensure safe driving."
