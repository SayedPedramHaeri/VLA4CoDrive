  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying green and red lights. The rain is falling heavily and the windshield wipers are in use.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy and wet road conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events indicate that the traffic is heavy and the driver needs to be attentive to avoid any accidents. The rainy weather also requires the driver to use the windshield wipers to maintain visibility and ensure safe driving."
