  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night city street with tall buildings on both sides. The road is wet and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are displaying green and yellow lights. The weather is rainy and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and there are frequent braking events or strong decelerations. The driver of the ego vehicle is likely being cautious due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is also following the traffic rules and regulations, slowing down when approaching intersections or traffic lights. The driver is likely using the vehicle's sensors and cameras to detect potential hazards and obstacles on the road, such as pedestrians or parked vehicles. Overall, the ego vehicle is behaving in a safe and responsible manner, taking into account the weather conditions and the traffic situation."
