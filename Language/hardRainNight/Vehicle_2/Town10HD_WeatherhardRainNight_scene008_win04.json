  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white and blue bus drives down a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.4 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the ego vehicle is likely reacting to the movements of other vehicles. The parked truck on the side of the road may also be contributing to the congestion."
