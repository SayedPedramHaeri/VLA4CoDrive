  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.0 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. Some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing green. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are also visible, and they seem to be walking at a moderate pace. The weather is foggy, and the visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is raining, and the road is wet. The frequent braking events are likely due to the reduced visibility and the presence of other cars on the street. The ego vehicle is also keeping a safe distance from the other cars to avoid any potential collisions. The traffic lights are showing green, and the pedestrians on the sidewalk are also visible, so the ego vehicle is driving cautiously to avoid any accidents."
