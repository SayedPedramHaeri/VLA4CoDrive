  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a bus stop and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are driving at a slower speed. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green and red lights. The parked truck is on the right side of the road, and there is a bus stop nearby.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It keeps a safe distance from the other cars on the road and adjusts its speed according to the traffic light signals. The driver of the ego vehicle is cautious and attentive to the surroundings, taking into account the reduced visibility and potential risks of pedestrians or hidden obstacles."
