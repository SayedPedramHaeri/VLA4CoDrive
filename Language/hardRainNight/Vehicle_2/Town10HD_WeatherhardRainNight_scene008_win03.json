  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with a white bus and a blue car on the road.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with a white bus and a blue car on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are tall buildings and streetlights on either side. The traffic is light, and the vehicles are moving slowly. The white bus is in the right lane, and the blue car is in the left lane. There is a red traffic light ahead, and the ego vehicle is slowing down to stop.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously on the rainy city streets because of the reduced visibility and the potential for slippery roads. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles ahead and adjusting their speed according to the traffic conditions. The presence of the red traffic light ahead indicates that the ego vehicle will soon have to stop, so the driver is preparing to brake. The tall buildings and streetlights provide some illumination in the dark night, but the overall lighting is still quite low due to the rain."
