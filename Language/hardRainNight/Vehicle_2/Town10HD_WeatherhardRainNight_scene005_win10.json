  "title": "Rainy night city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a parked truck on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars and a bus driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are mostly green, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is dark and rainy, with the headlights and streetlights illuminating the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to avoid hydroplaning on the wet road. It keeps a safe distance from the parked truck on the right and other vehicles on the road. The driver is attentive to the traffic lights and pedestrians, adjusting the speed and direction accordingly. The rainy weather requires extra caution and slower reaction times to avoid accidents."
