  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. Some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing green. There are also some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and they seem to be carrying umbrellas. The weather is dark and gloomy, and the visibility is somewhat reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It is also braking frequently to avoid collisions with other cars on the street. The traffic lights are showing green, so the ego vehicle can continue driving straight. However, the driver needs to be cautious of the pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, as they might suddenly step onto the road. The rain and reduced visibility also require the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive to the surroundings."
