  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street at night, with rain and hard braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a truck driving in the same direction. There are also pedestrians crossing the street at different points. The visibility is low due to the darkness and rain, and the traffic lights are visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully to avoid any accidents or skidding on the wet road. It is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and adjusting its speed according to the traffic conditions. The driver is being extra cautious due to the rainy weather and the presence of pedestrians. The hard braking events are likely caused by sudden changes in the traffic flow or unexpected obstacles on the road."
