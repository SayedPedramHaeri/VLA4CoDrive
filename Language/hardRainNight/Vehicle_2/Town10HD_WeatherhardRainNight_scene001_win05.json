  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a bus and other cars around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The traffic is light, with a bus and a few other cars driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the streetlights provide some illumination. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are moving back and forth.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently due to the rainy and slippery road conditions. The driver needs to be extra cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any accidents. The presence of the bus and other cars on the road adds to the complexity of the driving situation, as the driver needs to be aware of their movements and potential blind spots."
