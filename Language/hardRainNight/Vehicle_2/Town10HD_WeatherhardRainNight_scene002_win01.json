  "caption": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, including a red truck and a white car. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently green. The buildings and streetlights are illuminated by the city lights.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy and wet road conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of the red truck and the white car suggests that there is moderate traffic on this city street. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and following the rules of the road to ensure safe driving during these challenging weather conditions."
