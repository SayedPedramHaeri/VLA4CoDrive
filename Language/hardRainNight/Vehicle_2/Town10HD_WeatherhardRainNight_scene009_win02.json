  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street at night, with rain and hard braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a bus driving in the same direction. There are also pedestrians crossing the street at the crosswalks. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red. The visibility is low due to the rain and the night, but the streetlights and the headlights of the vehicles provide some illumination.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid skidding on the wet road. It is following a car in front of it and braking frequently to maintain a safe distance. The driver is cautious and attentive to the traffic and pedestrians around, adjusting the speed and direction accordingly. The rain and the night add to the difficulty of the driving task, requiring extra vigilance and caution."
