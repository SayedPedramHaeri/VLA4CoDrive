  "title": "Rainy night city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a parked truck and a crosswalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, driving at moderate speeds. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green lights. The parked truck is on the right side of the road, and the crosswalk is on the left side. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are in motion.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road to avoid any potential accidents. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and the crosswalk to ensure safe passage. The rain is making the road slippery, so the driver needs to be extra cautious and attentive to avoid any skidding or loss of control."
