  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving vehicle on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings on both sides. The road is wet and slippery. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, following a white car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking or slowing down. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all red. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are few and far between, and they are not doing anything unusual. The weather is dark and gloomy, with rain falling heavily on the windshield.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously because of the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is congested and unpredictable, so the ego vehicle needs to be extra vigilant and responsive. The tall buildings on both sides of the street create a canyon effect that amplifies the rainfall and reduces visibility. The ego vehicle's sensors detect the braking events and adjust the speed and distance accordingly to avoid collisions or accidents."
