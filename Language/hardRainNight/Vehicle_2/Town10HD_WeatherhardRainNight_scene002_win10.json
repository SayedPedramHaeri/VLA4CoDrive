  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with other cars and a red car parked on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The traffic is light, with only a few cars driving slowly. The rain is falling heavily, and the streetlights are on. There are several traffic lights and signs along the road, and the ego vehicle is almost stopped due to frequent braking.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully due to the rainy and dark conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other cars on the road. The driver must be cautious and attentive to maintain safety in these challenging driving conditions."
