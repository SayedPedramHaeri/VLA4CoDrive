  "caption": "A red bus drives on a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",

  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet from the rain. The red bus is driving on the left side of the road to avoid the wet road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the bus and other cars on the road. The streetlights and traffic lights are visible and the ego vehicle is following the traffic rules."
