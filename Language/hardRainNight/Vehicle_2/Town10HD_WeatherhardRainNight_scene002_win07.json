  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a parked truck and a red traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, driving at moderate speeds. A red traffic light is visible on the right side of the road. The parked truck is on the left side of the road, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street on the left side. The weather is rainy, and the rain is falling heavily.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety on the wet road. It passes a parked truck and a red traffic light, slowing down to ensure it obeys traffic rules. The pedestrian crossing the street on the left side of the road is a potential risk, and the ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from it. The rain is reducing visibility, and the ego vehicle is driving cautiously to avoid any accidents."
