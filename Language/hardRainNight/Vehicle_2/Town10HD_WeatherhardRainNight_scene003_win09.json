  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and there are multiple braking events. The traffic lights are visible in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on the rainy city street to ensure safety. The multiple braking events suggest that there are obstacles or other vehicles on the road that require the driver to slow down or stop. The tall buildings on both sides of the street may also affect visibility and driving conditions."
