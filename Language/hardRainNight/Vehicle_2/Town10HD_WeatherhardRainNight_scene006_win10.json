  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously on a rainy night, following a blue car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery, with rain falling heavily. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all red. The street is illuminated by the headlights of the cars and the streetlights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. It is following the blue car ahead and maintaining a safe distance. The driver is being extra cautious and paying close attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The rain is reducing visibility, so the driver is also relying on the headlights of other cars to see the road ahead."
