  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a city during a rainy night, with moderate traffic and several braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving in the right lane of a three-lane city street. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. A few pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalks. The traffic lights are visible at several intersections, and some of them are showing red or green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is maintaining a safe distance from the cars in front of it and adjusting its speed according to the traffic flow. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalks to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
