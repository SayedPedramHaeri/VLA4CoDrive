  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping at a red light.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.8 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It stops at the red light to avoid any accidents. The driver is cautious and aware of the potential risks, such as slippery roads and reduced visibility. The tall buildings and palm trees give a sense of the urban environment, and the pedestrians indicate that there are people around who might also be affected by the rain."
