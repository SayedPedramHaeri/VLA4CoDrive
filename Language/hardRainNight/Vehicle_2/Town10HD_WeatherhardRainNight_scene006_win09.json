  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rain-soaked city street, with other cars and traffic lights visible.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are on. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following the car in front of it.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the reduced visibility. The driver is being cautious and following the car in front of it to maintain a safe distance. The rain is causing the road to be slippery, so the driver needs to be extra careful when braking or turning. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the driver is obeying the traffic rules by slowing down when approaching a red light."
