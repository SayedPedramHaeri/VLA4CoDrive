  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with multiple stop signs.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, passing a stop sign.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The city street has multiple stop signs, and there are other cars and pedestrians on the road. The blue car is driving slowly and carefully, following the traffic rules and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, which can affect visibility and road grip. The multiple stop signs in the area require the driver to be extra cautious and attentive to avoid accidents. The frequent braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the driver is being very careful and is likely reacting to the challenging weather conditions."
