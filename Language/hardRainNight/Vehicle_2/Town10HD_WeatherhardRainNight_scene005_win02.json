  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.0 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The weather is dark and rainy, with visibility slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain control on the wet road. It frequently brakes to avoid potential risks and to ensure safe driving. The presence of other cars on the street requires the ego vehicle to be cautious and maintain a safe distance. The traffic lights and the large building on the right side of the road are important landmarks that help the ego vehicle navigate the city at night."
