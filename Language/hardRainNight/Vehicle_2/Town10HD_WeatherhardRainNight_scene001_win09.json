  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees. The road is wet and there are multiple braking events or strong decelerations. The traffic is light and there are no pedestrians or other obstacles visible.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees. The driver is cautious due to the wet road and reduced visibility. The multiple braking events or strong decelerations suggest that the driver is being extra careful to avoid any accidents. The lack of pedestrians or other obstacles visible in the video indicates that the driver has a clear view of the road ahead."
