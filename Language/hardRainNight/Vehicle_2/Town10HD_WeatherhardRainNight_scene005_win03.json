  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rainy and dark conditions, which reduce visibility and increase the risk of accidents. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being extra careful, possibly because of the challenging weather conditions. The presence of other cars on the street also requires the driver to be attentive and responsive to avoid collisions."
