  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously, with 7 instances of braking or strong deceleration.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving on the right side of the road, and there are other cars on the road, some of them are also driving slowly. There are traffic lights at the intersections, and some of them are red. The tall buildings and palm trees are on the left side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the headlights of the ego vehicle are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being extra careful because of the reduced visibility and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The 7 instances of braking or strong deceleration indicate that the driver is reacting to potential risks or obstacles on the road. The driver is also following the traffic rules and regulations, and is being considerate of other road users."
