  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a rainy city street at night. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. The road is wet and slippery. The traffic is light, with only a few cars visible in the distance. The rain is falling heavily, reducing visibility. The streetlights are on, illuminating the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy and slippery road conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is being extra cautious, possibly due to reduced visibility. The presence of tall buildings on both sides of the street could also be a factor, as they may obstruct the view of oncoming traffic or pedestrians. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging weather conditions."
