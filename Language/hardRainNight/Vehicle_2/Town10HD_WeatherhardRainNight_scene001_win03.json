  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.3 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and wet streets. The ego vehicle is driving down the street at a moderate speed, with other cars and pedestrians visible on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the weather is rainy, with raindrops visible on the windshield. The road is wet, and the vehicles are leaving visible tire tracks on the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy weather conditions, which can make the road slippery and more difficult to control. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of other cars and pedestrians suggests that the driver is navigating a busy urban environment, where they need to be constantly aware of their surroundings to avoid accidents. Overall, the video captures the challenges and risks of driving in a rainy city at night, and the importance of staying alert and focused on the road."
