  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are displaying green and red lights. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are also visible and seem to be walking slowly. The weather is rainy and the rain is falling heavily on the windshield.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic. The driver is being cautious due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front and is prepared to brake if necessary. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The rain is reducing visibility and making the road slippery, so the driver is driving slowly to ensure safety."
