  "title": "Rainy night driving on a wet city street with palm trees and other cars.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night on a wet city street with palm trees and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is moving slowly, and there are other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the rain is falling heavily.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety on the wet road. The driver is cautious and paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The rain is making the road slippery, so the driver needs to be extra careful to avoid any accidents. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are also visible, and the driver needs to be aware of their presence to ensure their safety as well."
