  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city, with other cars and pedestrians visible.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a white car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also driving slowly, while others are stationary. There are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and some of them are carrying umbrellas. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying red and green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions and the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it and adjusting the speed according to the traffic situation. The driver is also paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
