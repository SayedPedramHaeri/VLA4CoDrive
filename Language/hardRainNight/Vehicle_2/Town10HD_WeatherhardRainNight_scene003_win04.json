  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are green, and there is a red digital sign on the side of the road. The weather is dark and rainy, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the digital sign to ensure they follow the rules of the road and avoid any potential hazards."
