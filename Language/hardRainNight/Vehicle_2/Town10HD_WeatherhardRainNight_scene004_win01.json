  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with many other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The blue car is driving slowly and carefully, following a white van in front of it. There are many other cars and pedestrians on the street, and some of them are also braking or stopping. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing red or green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rainy and dark conditions. It is maintaining a safe distance from the white van in front of it and is prepared to brake or stop if necessary. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata suggest that other vehicles on the street are also adapting to the challenging weather conditions. The ego vehicle is paying close attention to the traffic lights and other road users to ensure a safe journey."
