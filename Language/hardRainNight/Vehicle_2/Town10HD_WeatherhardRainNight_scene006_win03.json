  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with a red truck on the left.",
  "caption": "Moderate-speed driving on a rainy night on a city street with a red truck on the left.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It is keeping a safe distance from the red truck on the left to avoid any potential collisions. The driver is also paying attention to the pedestrian crossing the street and the traffic lights in the distance to navigate the road safely."
