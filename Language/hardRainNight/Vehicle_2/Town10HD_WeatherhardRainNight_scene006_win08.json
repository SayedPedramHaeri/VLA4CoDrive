  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is following a blue car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, and some of them are also slowing down due to the rain. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green and red lights. The streetlights are illuminating the road, and there are some buildings and shops on the sides of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It is following the blue car in front of it at a safe distance, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the traffic lights and other vehicles on the road. The rain is reducing visibility, so the driver is relying on the streetlights and the headlights of the other vehicles to see the road ahead."
