  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with palm trees and a blue car on the road.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with palm trees and a blue car on the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large billboard on the side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid potential hazards.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, which can make it harder to see and react to other vehicles and obstacles on the road. The frequent braking events indicate that the ego vehicle is being cautious and trying to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. The presence of the blue car on the road suggests that there may be other drivers who are also trying to navigate the challenging weather conditions."
