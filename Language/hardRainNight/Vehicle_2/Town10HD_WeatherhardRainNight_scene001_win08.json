  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are many other cars on the road.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a city at night, with rain and tall buildings.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are many other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are palm trees lining the street. The weather is rainy and dark, with low visibility.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid any potential accidents due to the rain and low visibility. It is also maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. The tall buildings and palm trees suggest that this is a city in a warm climate."
