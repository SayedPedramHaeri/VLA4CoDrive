  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed and 3 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night on a city street with moderate speed and 3 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.3 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving carefully and slowly, following the other cars.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and following the other cars to avoid any potential accidents. The 3 braking events could be due to the slippery road surface caused by the rain. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road to prevent any collisions."
