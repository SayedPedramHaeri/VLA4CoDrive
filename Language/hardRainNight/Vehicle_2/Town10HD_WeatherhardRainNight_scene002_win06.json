  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a parked truck and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving in the right lane, passing a parked truck on the left side. There are other cars in the distance, and a traffic light is visible in the background. The rain is falling heavily, and the headlights of the ego vehicle are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It passes a parked truck, which is on the left side of the road. The traffic light in the background is red, and the ego vehicle is preparing to stop. The rain is heavy, and the headlights are on to improve visibility."
