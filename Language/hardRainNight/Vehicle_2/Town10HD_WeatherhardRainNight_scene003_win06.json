  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with tall buildings and many pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously, following a car in front of it. There are many pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red. The tall buildings on either side of the street create a canyon-like effect, amplifying the sound of rainfall.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain control on the slippery road. It is following the car in front of it at a safe distance, braking frequently to avoid collisions. The presence of pedestrians on the crosswalk requires the driver to be extra cautious and alert. The red traffic lights indicate that the ego vehicle should stop or slow down. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and adapting to the challenging weather conditions."
