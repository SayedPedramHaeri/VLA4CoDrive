  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are many other vehicles on the road, some of them are braking or changing lanes. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are green. There are also some pedestrians on the sidewalk and some parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet and slippery due to the rain. The frequent braking events are likely caused by the presence of other vehicles on the road and the need to maintain a safe distance. The ego vehicle is also prepared to slow down or stop if necessary to avoid any potential risks. The green traffic lights and the visible pedestrians on the sidewalk suggest that the ego vehicle is following the traffic rules and regulations. Overall, the ego vehicle is behaving cautiously and responsibly in this rainy night city driving scenario."
