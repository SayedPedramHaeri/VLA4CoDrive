  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously on a rainy night, following a blue car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery, with rain falling heavily. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all green. The sidewalks are also wet, and there are a few pedestrians walking on them.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. It is following the blue car ahead of it, maintaining a safe distance. The ego vehicle is also cautious of the pedestrians on the sidewalks, and it slows down when approaching intersections or crossings. The rainy weather reduces visibility, so the ego vehicle relies on its sensors and the traffic lights to navigate safely."
