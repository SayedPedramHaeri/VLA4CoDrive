  "caption": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",

  "description": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently. The road is wet and slippery. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The pedestrians are few and they are walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously because of the rainy weather conditions. It brakes frequently to avoid any potential accidents. The other cars on the road are also driving slowly and carefully. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are currently showing green light. The pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk and they are not crossing the road at the moment."
