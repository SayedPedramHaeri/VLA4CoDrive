  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk.",
  "caption": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.6 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions, and there are several other cars on the road that are also driving slowly. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk add to the urban atmosphere of the scene."
