  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a bus and a red car behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street. There is a bus and a red car behind it. The road is wet and visibility is low. The traffic lights are red and there are no pedestrians on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy weather and the multiple braking events ahead. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the bus and the red car behind it. The rain is reducing visibility and making the road slippery, so the driver needs to be extra careful. The red traffic lights indicate that the cars need to stop, and the absence of pedestrians on the sidewalk suggests that it is a quiet and deserted area."
