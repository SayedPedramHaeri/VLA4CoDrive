  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city with moderate speed. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are green. The sidewalks are lit up with street lights and there are some parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet and visibility is low. The frequent braking events are likely due to the presence of other cars on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the cars in front of it and is prepared to stop or slow down if necessary. The green traffic lights indicate that it is safe to continue driving."
