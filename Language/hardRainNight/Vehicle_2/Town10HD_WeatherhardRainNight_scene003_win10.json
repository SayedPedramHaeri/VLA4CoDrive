  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy city street with tall buildings and a roundabout.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rain and the potential risks of pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events indicate that the traffic is congested and requires extra caution. The roundabout and the tall buildings add complexity to the driving situation, as the driver needs to be aware of the traffic flow and the road layout."
