  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue and white car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a white car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also driving slowly. There are also a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rain and the low visibility. It is following the white car in front of it at a safe distance, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The rain is making the road slippery, so the ego vehicle needs to be extra cautious. It is also important to be aware of the pedestrians and other vehicles on the road, as they may also be affected by the rain. Overall, the ego vehicle is prioritizing safety and driving defensively in these challenging conditions."
