  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a city street during a rainy night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.5 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery, and the visibility is low. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are on. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, and there are several braking events in this clip.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety during the rainy night. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. The rain is making the road slippery, and the driver needs to be extra careful to avoid any accidents. The braking events in the video indicate that the driver is reacting to the changing traffic conditions and adjusting the speed accordingly."
