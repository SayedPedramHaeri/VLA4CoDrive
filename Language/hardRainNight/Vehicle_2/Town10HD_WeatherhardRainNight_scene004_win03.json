  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue car driving slowly in a rainy city at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly on a rainy city street at night. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking frequently. The road is wet and visibility is low. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street and a large roundabout in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and the drivers are being cautious. The ego vehicle is almost stopped because it is approaching a red light. The large roundabout in the distance indicates that the road layout is complex and requires careful navigation."
