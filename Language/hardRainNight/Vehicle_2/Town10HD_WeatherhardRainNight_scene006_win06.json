  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.7 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is following a blue car in front of it. There are other cars on the road, and some of them are also driving slowly. There are street lights and traffic lights along the road, and some of the traffic lights are red. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It is following the blue car in front of it at a safe distance, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk, and is adjusting the speed and direction of the vehicle accordingly. The rain and the reduced visibility make it important to be extra cautious and to allow extra time for braking and reacting to any unexpected events."
