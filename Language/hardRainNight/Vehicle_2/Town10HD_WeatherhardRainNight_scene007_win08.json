  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city, with other cars and pedestrians visible.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a white car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also slowing down due to the rain. Pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalks, and a few parked cars are visible on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are showing red or green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully due to the rainy weather conditions. It maintains a safe distance from the car in front of it and adjusts its speed according to the traffic situation. The driver is paying attention to the pedestrians and parked cars on the side of the road to avoid any potential accidents. The rain reduces visibility, so the driver needs to be extra cautious and vigilant while driving."
