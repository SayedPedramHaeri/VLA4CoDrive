  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a rainy city at night, changing lanes and following a car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 0.9 m/s). There are 27 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are tall buildings and palm trees lining the street. The weather is dark and rainy, and the visibility is somewhat limited. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes to avoid the other cars on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to ensure safety and avoid any potential accidents. It is changing lanes to get a better view of the road ahead and to avoid getting stuck behind slower-moving vehicles. The tall buildings and palm trees suggest that this is a city in a warm climate. The rain and darkness make it more challenging to see and anticipate potential hazards on the road."
