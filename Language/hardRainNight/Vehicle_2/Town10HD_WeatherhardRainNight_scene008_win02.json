  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A blue and white bus drives down a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a white car in front of it. There are other cars on the road, and a blue and white bus is driving in the opposite direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the street is illuminated by the headlights of the vehicles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions, and the frequent braking events suggest that the driver is trying to maintain a safe distance from the car in front. The presence of the bus and other cars on the road adds to the complexity of the driving situation, requiring the driver to be extra vigilant and attentive."
