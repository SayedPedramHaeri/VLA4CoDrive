    "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
    "caption": "A blue car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
    "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
    "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, and there are several other cars on the road, some of which are braking or changing lanes.",
    "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the road. The frequent braking events are likely due to the rainy conditions, which can make it harder to see and react to other vehicles on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars and adjusting its speed accordingly to avoid any potential accidents."
