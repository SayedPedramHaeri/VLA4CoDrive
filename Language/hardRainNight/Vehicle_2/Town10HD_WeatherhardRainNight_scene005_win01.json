  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.1 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is dark and rainy, with the rain falling heavily. The streetlights are on, and the headlights of the cars are on as well.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy conditions, which can make the road slippery. The frequent braking events are likely due to the need to slow down or stop for other cars or pedestrians on the street. The ego vehicle is also maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid collisions. The tall building on the right side of the road may be an office building or a hotel, and the traffic lights are there to regulate the flow of traffic. Overall, the ego vehicle is driving carefully and cautiously in the rainy conditions to ensure safety."
