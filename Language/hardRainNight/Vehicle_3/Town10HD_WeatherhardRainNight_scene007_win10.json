  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street at night, with other cars and traffic lights.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently. There are other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. There is a traffic light on the corner of the street, and a large building in the background.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rain and low visibility. It brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other cars on the road. The traffic light on the corner of the street is red, which causes the ego vehicle to stop. The large building in the background adds to the urban environment of the scene."
