  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.4 m/s). There are 23 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several parked cars on the side of the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is low.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain control on the wet road. The multiple braking events suggest that there are obstacles or other vehicles on the road that require the driver to slow down or stop. The driver must be cautious and attentive to avoid accidents in these conditions."
