  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives on a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a red car on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It passes a red car on the right, and there is a green traffic light ahead. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are visible, and the ego vehicle keeps a safe distance from them. The rainy weather requires the driver to be extra cautious and attentive to the road conditions."
