  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the left side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following the car in front of it.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, which can reduce visibility and make it harder to see other vehicles and pedestrians. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and that the other cars on the road are also slowing down and stopping frequently. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it and is prepared to stop or slow down further if necessary. The rainy weather also means that the ego vehicle needs to be extra cautious when turning or changing lanes, as the wet road surface can make it harder to control the vehicle's movements."
