  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy night on a city street with tall buildings on both sides. The road is wet and there are several other cars driving in the same direction. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are all green. The rain is falling heavily and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid any accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night to ensure safety. The multiple braking events indicate that the driver is being cautious and paying attention to the road conditions. The rain and low visibility make it difficult to see the other vehicles and pedestrians, so the driver is taking extra precautions to avoid any collisions. The tall buildings on both sides of the street create a canyon effect, which further reduces the visibility. Overall, the ego vehicle is driving carefully and responsibly in the challenging weather conditions."
