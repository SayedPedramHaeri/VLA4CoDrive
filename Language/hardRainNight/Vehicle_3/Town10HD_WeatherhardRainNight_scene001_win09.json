  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The red car is driving slowly and stopping frequently due to the rain and heavy traffic.",
  "caption": "A red car driving slowly in the rain on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and they are showing red and green lights. The tall buildings and palm trees are illuminated by streetlights and neon signs.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and stopping frequently because of the rain and the heavy traffic. The driver needs to be extra cautious and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid collisions. The rain reduces visibility and makes it harder to judge the speed and distance of other cars. The driver must also pay attention to the traffic lights and pedestrians crossing the street."
