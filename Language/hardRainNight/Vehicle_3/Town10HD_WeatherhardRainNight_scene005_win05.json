  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.2 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain control on the slippery road. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The rainy weather conditions require extra caution and longer braking distances."
