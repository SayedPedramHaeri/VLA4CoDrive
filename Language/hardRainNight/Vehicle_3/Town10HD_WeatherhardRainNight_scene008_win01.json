  "title": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, braking frequently",
  "caption": "A red car drives on a rainy city street at night, with a large bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The traffic is light, with only a few cars and pedestrians around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all green. The rain is falling heavily, creating a misty atmosphere.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions. It frequently brakes to avoid potential hazards on the road. The large bus behind the red car is also driving slowly, maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are mostly staying under the awnings of the nearby buildings to avoid getting wet. The ego vehicle's cautious driving is essential to ensure safety and prevent accidents in these challenging weather conditions."
