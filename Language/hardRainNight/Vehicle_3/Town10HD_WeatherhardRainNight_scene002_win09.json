  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.1 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving carefully and slowly, trying to avoid any potential hazards.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because of the rainy and slippery road conditions. It is also braking frequently to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and vigilant, paying close attention to the traffic lights and other potential hazards. The rain is making it more difficult to see clearly, so the driver is trying to stay alert and focused to avoid any accidents."
