  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a white bus following behind.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a bus on the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are sparse. The weather is rainy, and the headlights of the vehicles are on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions. The white bus behind the red car is following at a safe distance, and the multiple braking events suggest that the traffic ahead is congested. The driver of the ego vehicle must remain vigilant and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
