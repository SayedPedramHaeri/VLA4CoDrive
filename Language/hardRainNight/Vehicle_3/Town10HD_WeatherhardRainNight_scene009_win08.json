  "title": "Rainy night city driving with a red car in front.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain, following a red car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery, with rain falling heavily. The city lights reflect off the wet pavement. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also driving slowly. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are all red. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in the rain to ensure safety and avoid accidents. The driver is being cautious and following the red car in front, maintaining a safe distance. The rainy weather conditions make it harder to see the road ahead, so the driver is relying on the traffic lights and other vehicles to navigate the city streets. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful and is prepared to stop at any moment to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians."
