  "title": "Rainy night city driving, almost stopped, pedestrian crossing",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy night in a city street, with a pedestrian crossing.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street. There is a pedestrian crossing the street. The road is wet and visibility is low. The traffic is light and there are no obstacles on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. The pedestrian crossing the street is a potential safety hazard, so the ego vehicle must be cautious and prepared to stop if necessary. The rainy weather also requires the ego vehicle to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road to avoid any accidents."
