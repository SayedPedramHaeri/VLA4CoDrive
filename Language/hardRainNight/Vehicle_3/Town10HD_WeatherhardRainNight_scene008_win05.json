  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A white and blue bus drives down a rainy city street at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the street. The bus is driving slowly, and there is a red car parked on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the streetlights provide some illumination. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is somewhat reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and wet road conditions. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and that the other vehicles are also adjusting their speed accordingly. The bus is maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles to avoid any potential accidents. The rainy weather requires extra caution and slower speeds to ensure safe driving."
