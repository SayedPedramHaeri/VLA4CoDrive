  "title": "Rainy night city driving with a red car and a bus on the road.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street at night, with a red car and a bus nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars driving around. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The weather is dark and rainy, which makes the visibility a bit challenging.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid any accidents due to the slippery road conditions. It is maintaining a safe distance from the red car and the bus, and it is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary. The driver is being extra cautious because of the hard rain and the potential risks of pedestrians crossing the street or other vehicles merging into the lane."
