  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with a green car in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the street. The weather is dark and rainy, with visibility slightly reduced.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It is keeping a safe distance from the green car in front of it, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The rainy weather requires extra caution and slower speeds to avoid accidents."
