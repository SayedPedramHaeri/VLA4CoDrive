  "title": "Rainy night driving on a wet city street with palm trees and other cars.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night on a wet city street with palm trees and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly, and there are other cars on the road. The traffic lights are visible, and they are showing red and green lights. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rain and the low visibility. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The rain is causing the road to be slippery, and the driver needs to be extra careful when braking or turning. The driver is also paying attention to the pedestrians walking on the sidewalk to avoid any accidents."
