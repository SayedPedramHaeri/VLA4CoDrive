  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a bus driving in the same direction. There are also a few parked cars on the side of the road. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rain and the low visibility. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and adjusting its speed according to the traffic situation. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the pedestrians and the potential risks of the rainy conditions."
