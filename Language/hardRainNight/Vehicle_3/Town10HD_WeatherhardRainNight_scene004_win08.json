  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.9 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a white car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking or slowing down. There are tall buildings on either side of the street, and the streetlights are on. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are moving back and forth. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully due to the rainy and dark conditions. It maintains a safe distance from the car in front of it and slows down or brakes when necessary to avoid potential accidents. The driver is paying close attention to the road and the surrounding traffic, adjusting the speed and direction of the vehicle accordingly. The rain and low visibility make it important to stay alert and focused, and the driver is taking all necessary precautions to ensure safe driving."
