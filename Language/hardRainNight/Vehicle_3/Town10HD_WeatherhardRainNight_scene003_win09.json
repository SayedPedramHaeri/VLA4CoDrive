  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a few pedestrians on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully because of the rain and the low visibility. It is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians on the sidewalk, making sure to follow all the traffic rules and regulations."
