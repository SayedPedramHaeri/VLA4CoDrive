  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a rainy city at night.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are palm trees lining the street. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is braking frequently, and there are several other cars on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently because of the rainy weather conditions. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The presence of tall buildings and palm trees suggests that this is a city street, and the traffic lights indicate that there are intersections ahead. The driver needs to be attentive and prepared to react to any potential hazards on the road, such as pedestrians or other vehicles."
