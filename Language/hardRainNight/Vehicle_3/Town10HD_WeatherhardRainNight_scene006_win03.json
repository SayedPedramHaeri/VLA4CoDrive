  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate speed.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, passing a red car on the left and a bus on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are driving at a slower speed. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the streetlights provide some illumination. The rain is falling heavily, and the windshield wipers are in use.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safety on the wet road. It passes a red car on the left and a bus on the right, both of which are also driving at a slower speed due to the rainy conditions. The ego vehicle keeps a safe distance from other vehicles and adjusts its speed according to the traffic situation. It is important to be cautious and attentive while driving in the rain to avoid potential accidents."
