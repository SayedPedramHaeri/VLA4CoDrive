  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.2 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are showing red and green lights. The pedestrians are also present on the sidewalk, and some of them are walking in the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently to ensure safety on the rainy road. The driver is being cautious and following the traffic rules. The rain and low visibility make it difficult to see the obstacles ahead, so the driver is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. The tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road create a beautiful but challenging environment for driving."
