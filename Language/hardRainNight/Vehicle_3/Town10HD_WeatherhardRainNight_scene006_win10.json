  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is following a red car in front of it. There are several other cars on the road, and some of them are also slowing down due to the rain. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green and red lights. The streetlights are illuminating the road, and there are palm trees lining the street.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It is keeping a safe distance from the red car in front of it, and it is adjusting its speed according to the traffic flow. The ego vehicle is also paying attention to the traffic lights and the pedestrians who may be crossing the street. Overall, the ego vehicle is behaving cautiously and responsibly in the challenging weather conditions."
