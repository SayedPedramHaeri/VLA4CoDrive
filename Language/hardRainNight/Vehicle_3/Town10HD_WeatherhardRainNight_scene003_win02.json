  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly on a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy city street at night. There are many other cars on the road, some of which are also braking. The road is wet and visibility is reduced due to the rain. There are tall buildings and streetlights on either side of the street. The traffic lights are mostly red and green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly due to the rainy and wet road conditions, which can be slippery and require extra caution. The multiple braking events suggest that other vehicles on the road are also adapting their driving behavior to the challenging conditions. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of it and is prepared to stop or change lanes as needed to avoid potential accidents."
