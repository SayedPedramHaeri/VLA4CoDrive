  "caption": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, 24 braking events",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.2 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "Rainy night city driving, ego vehicle almost stopped, 24 braking events. The road is wet and slippery. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance. The pedestrians are using umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy weather conditions. It is braking frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the cars in front of it. The pedestrians and traffic lights are also being carefully observed to ensure safe navigation through the city streets."
