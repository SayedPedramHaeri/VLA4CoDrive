  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a rainy night in a city street with moderate speed and braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street, some of which are also braking. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is dark and rainy, which affects visibility.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. It slows down and brakes when necessary to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The driver must be cautious and attentive to the surroundings to ensure safe driving in such weather conditions."
