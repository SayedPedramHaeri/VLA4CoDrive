  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple parked cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a car in front of it. There are several parked cars on the side of the road, and pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and they are displaying green and red lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain safety in the rainy conditions. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the pedestrians and parked cars on the side of the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the driver is anticipating potential risks and reacting accordingly to avoid accidents."
