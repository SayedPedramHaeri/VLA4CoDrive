  "title": "Rainy night driving on a city street with moderate traffic.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and cautiously on a rainy night, following a red car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet and slippery, with rain falling heavily. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving ahead and beside the ego vehicle. There are tall street lights and palm trees on the sidewalk. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is marked with white lines.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain control and avoid skidding on the wet road. It is following the red car ahead at a safe distance, and it is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The driver is cautious and alert, taking into account the reduced visibility and potential hazards posed by the rainy weather."
