  "title": "Rainy night city driving with moderate speed and frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed, with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is driving carefully and slowly, with the brake lights on.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather conditions and the presence of other vehicles on the road. The frequent braking events indicate that the driver is being extra careful to avoid any accidents. The large building on the right side of the road may also be a factor in the driver's cautious approach, as it could obstruct the view of any pedestrians or obstacles on the road. Overall, the driver is prioritizing safety and being mindful of the challenging driving conditions."
