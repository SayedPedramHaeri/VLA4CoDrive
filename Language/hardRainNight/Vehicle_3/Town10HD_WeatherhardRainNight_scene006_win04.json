  "title": "Rainy night city driving, moderate speed, no significant braking",
  "caption": "A red bus drives on the left side of the road, passing a parked truck and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and the visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving straight, following a red bus that is driving on the left side of the road. There are other cars and pedestrians on the road, and a traffic light is visible in the distance. The rain is falling heavily, and the streetlights are illuminating the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a moderate speed to ensure safe driving in the rainy conditions. It keeps a safe distance from the red bus in front, and it is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary. The parked truck and the traffic light are potential obstacles or hazards that the ego vehicle must be aware of while driving."
