  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.5 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a large building on the right side of the road. The rain is falling heavily, and the visibility is reduced. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and carefully, braking frequently to avoid accidents.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy and dark conditions, which can reduce visibility and make it harder to anticipate other vehicles' movements. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being extra careful, possibly due to the challenging weather conditions. The presence of other cars on the road also requires the driver to be attentive and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
