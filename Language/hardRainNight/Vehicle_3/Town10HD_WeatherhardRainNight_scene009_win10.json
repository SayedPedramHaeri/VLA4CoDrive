  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a rainy city street at moderate speed.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other cars on the street. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there is a tall building on the right side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and changing lanes to avoid obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously due to the rainy weather and the presence of other vehicles on the road. It slows down and changes lanes to maintain a safe distance from the cars ahead. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the drivers need to be extra careful to avoid accidents. The tall building on the right side of the road could be an office building or a hotel, and it adds to the urban atmosphere of the scene."
