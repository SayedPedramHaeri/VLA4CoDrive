  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.4 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic. The road is wet and visibility is reduced. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also driving slowly. There are also a few pedestrians visible on the sidewalks. The traffic lights are visible in the distance and are currently displaying green lights.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with moderate traffic. The driver is being cautious due to the wet road conditions and reduced visibility. The driver is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The driver is also keeping an eye out for pedestrians and other potential hazards."
