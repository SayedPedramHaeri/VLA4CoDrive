  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city street with multiple parked cars and a stop sign.",
  "caption": "The red car is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city street with multiple parked cars and a stop sign.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain and the visibility is low. The red car is driving slowly and carefully, following the white car in front of it. There are multiple parked cars on the side of the road and a stop sign at the intersection. The traffic lights are green and the pedestrians are absent from the scene.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because of the rainy and dark conditions, which reduce visibility and increase the risk of accidents. The driver is following the white car in front of it and maintaining a safe distance. The multiple parked cars and the stop sign at the intersection require the driver to be extra cautious and attentive to avoid any collisions or violations. The green traffic lights indicate that it is safe to proceed, but the driver must remain vigilant and prepared to react to any unexpected events or obstacles."
