  "title": "Rainy night driving in a city with tall buildings and palm trees. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a rainy night in a city with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and there are several other vehicles on the road, including a red car and a white bus. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and there are some parked cars on the side of the road. The weather is rainy, and the visibility is moderate. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and braking frequently, possibly due to the rainy conditions.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously on the rainy city streets, braking frequently to avoid potential accidents. The driver is likely being extra careful due to the reduced visibility and slippery road conditions. The tall buildings and palm trees in the background add to the urban atmosphere of the scene."
