  "title": "Rainy night city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives slowly down a rainy city street at night, with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is rainy (hardRainNight). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is wet from the rain, and visibility is low. The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following a car ahead. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are also braking frequently. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and some of them are red. The pedestrians on the sidewalk are few and far between, and there are no obstacles or hazards on the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving cautiously because of the rainy and dark conditions, which reduce visibility and increase the risk of accidents. The frequent braking events suggest that other drivers on the road are also adapting to the challenging weather conditions. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the car ahead and adjusts its speed accordingly to avoid any sudden braking or collisions."
