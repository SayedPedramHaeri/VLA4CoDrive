  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a blue car in the right lane.",
  "caption": "A person is driving a car on a city street with a blue car in the right lane.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with two lanes in each direction. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car in the right lane. The weather is clear and sunny. There are no pedestrians or obstacles visible in the video.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and staying in the left lane. It slows down as it approaches the intersection and prepares to turn right. The blue car in the right lane is maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle's braking events are likely due to traffic ahead or changing traffic signals."
