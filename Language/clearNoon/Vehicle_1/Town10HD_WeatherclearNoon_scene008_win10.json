  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a focus on traffic lights and pedestrians.",
  "caption": "A purple car drives through a city intersection, stopping for a red traffic light and yielding to pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city intersection with multiple lanes and traffic lights. There are several cars and pedestrians in the scene, and the weather is clear. The ego vehicle is a purple car that stops at the red traffic light and then proceeds when the light turns green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle stops at the red traffic light to ensure safety and follows the traffic rules. It then proceeds when the light turns green, paying attention to pedestrians crossing the street. The multiple braking events in the driving metadata indicate that the ego vehicle is cautious and prioritizes safety."
