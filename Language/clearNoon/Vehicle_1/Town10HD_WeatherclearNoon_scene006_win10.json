  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a city street with palm trees and a traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection with a green traffic light. It is also maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road, including the parked truck. The driver is cautious and paying attention to potential risks, such as the pedestrian crossing the street. The 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is being extra cautious and braking early to avoid any accidents."
