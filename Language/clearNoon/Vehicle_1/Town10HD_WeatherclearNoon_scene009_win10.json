  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A police car drives down a city street with a red truck and a yellow taxi cab.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.8 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The police car is driving down a busy city street with a red truck and a yellow taxi cab. There are several other cars on the road, and the traffic is moving slowly. The weather is clear and sunny, and there are tall buildings on either side of the street. There are also several traffic lights and a roundabout in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The police car is driving down the city street, following the flow of traffic. It slows down as it approaches the red truck and the yellow taxi cab, maintaining a safe distance from them. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is congested and the vehicles are constantly stopping and starting. The police car is likely patrolling the area, ensuring the safety of the drivers and pedestrians on the street."
