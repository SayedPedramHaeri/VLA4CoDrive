  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several other cars on the road, including a white bus and a red car. The traffic light is green, and there is a tall building in the background. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight and maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road.

The driver is cautious and pays attention to the traffic light and the surrounding vehicles to ensure safe driving."
