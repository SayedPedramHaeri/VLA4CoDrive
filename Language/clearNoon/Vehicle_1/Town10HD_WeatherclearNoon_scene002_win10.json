  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A black car drives down a city street with a red traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with a speed limit of 30 mph. There are several cars and a bus on the road. The traffic light is red and the pedestrian crossing light is green. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and braking frequently, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. The red traffic light and the green pedestrian crossing light indicate that the ego vehicle should stop and yield to pedestrians. The parked cars on the side of the road and the bus in the distance suggest that this is a busy city street with a mix of traffic types."
