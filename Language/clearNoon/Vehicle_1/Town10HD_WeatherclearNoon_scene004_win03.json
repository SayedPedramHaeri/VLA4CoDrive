  "title": "Clear Noon, Moderate-Speed City Driving with Ego Vehicle Almost Stopped",
  "caption": "Ego vehicle driving slowly in a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows the ego vehicle driving slowly on a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians. The road is wet, and there are tall buildings on both sides. The traffic light is green, and there is a parked truck on the side of the road. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection, and the traffic light is green. The driver is being cautious and following the speed limit to ensure safety. The parked truck on the side of the road could be an obstacle if the driver needs to change lanes or make a turn. The tall buildings on both sides of the road could also cause some visibility issues if there are any sudden changes in traffic."
