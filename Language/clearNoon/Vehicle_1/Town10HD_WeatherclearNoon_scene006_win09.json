  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with 11 braking events",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a city street with palm trees and a clear sky.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is in a city environment with many other cars and pedestrians. The driver needs to be cautious and pay attention to the traffic light and pedestrians. The 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is being extra cautious and following the traffic rules carefully."
