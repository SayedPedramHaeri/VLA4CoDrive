  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a parked truck on the left side of the road.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a city street with a parked truck on the left side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving down a city street with a tall building in the background. There are several other cars on the road, including a red bus and a black car. The road is wet and there is a yellow traffic light on the right side of the road. The weather is clear and there are trees and bushes on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The white car is driving at a moderate speed and is following the black car in front of it. The parked truck on the left side of the road is blocking one lane, causing the white car to stay in the right lane. The driver of the white car is paying attention to the traffic light on the right side of the road, making sure to obey the traffic rules. The tall building in the background adds to the urban atmosphere of the scene."
