  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a focus on traffic lights and pedestrians.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a city street with a red truck and a white bus in the background.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with a speed limit of 30 mph. There are several cars and a bus on the road. The traffic light is green, and there are palm trees on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and following the white car in front of it. It slows down when approaching the traffic light and stops when the light turns red. The red truck and the white bus are in the background, and the pedestrians on the sidewalk are walking normally. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the other vehicles and the pedestrians, and it is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary."
