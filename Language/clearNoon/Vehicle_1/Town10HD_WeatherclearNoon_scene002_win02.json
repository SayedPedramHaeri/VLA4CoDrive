  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 5 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives slowly on a busy city street, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.6 m/s). There are 5 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a wide city street with 4 lanes and a green traffic light. There are other cars driving in the same direction, including a red car and a white bus. Pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes when approaching intersections or when other cars change lanes. The driver is cautious and attentive, keeping a safe distance from other vehicles. The presence of pedestrians and the green traffic light suggest that the ego vehicle should be prepared to stop or yield when necessary."
