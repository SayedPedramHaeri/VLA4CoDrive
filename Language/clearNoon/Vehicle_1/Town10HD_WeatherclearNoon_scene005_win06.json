  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 1 braking event.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with moderate speed and 1 braking event.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The road is lined with trees and buildings, and there is a traffic light on the left side of the street. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is in a city environment with moderate traffic. The 1 braking event may be due to a car in front of the ego vehicle slowing down or stopping. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and is prepared to stop or change lanes if necessary."
