  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street with moderate traffic and 8 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.8 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on a city street with moderate traffic. There are several parked cars on the side of the road, and a tall building can be seen in the distance. The road is wet, and there are several traffic lights and stop signs along the way. The weather is clear and sunny, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on the city street because there is no immediate need to change lanes or turn. However, there are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window, which may indicate that the traffic ahead is slowing down or stopping. The ego vehicle must maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead to avoid collisions. The tall building in the distance may also be a potential landmark for navigation purposes."
