  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with moderate speed and 4 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.9 m/s). There are 4 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The road is lined with buildings and trees, and there are several traffic lights and street signs visible. The weather is clear and sunny, with good visibility.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is navigating a city street with other vehicles and obstacles. It slows down and brakes at 4 different points, possibly to avoid collisions or to follow traffic rules. The driver of the ego vehicle must be cautious and attentive to maintain safety in this busy urban environment."
