  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a white bus and a parked truck.",
  "caption": "A white bus passes by while the ego vehicle drives on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several other cars and a parked truck on the side of the road. The traffic light is green, and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and stays in the right lane. It slows down as it approaches the intersection and the parked truck. The white bus passes by, and the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from it. The pedestrian is crossing the street carefully, and the traffic light remains green. The ego vehicle is programmed to follow traffic rules and prioritize safety."
