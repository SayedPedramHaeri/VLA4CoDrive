  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The white car is driving on a city street with a bus and a red car. There are tall buildings on the side of the road and palm trees. The road is wet and there is a crosswalk in the distance. The traffic light is green.",
  "reasoning": "The white car is driving at a moderate speed and following the red car in front of it. The bus is on the left side of the road. The ego vehicle is approaching a crosswalk and slowing down because the traffic light is green. The driver is paying attention to the pedestrians and other vehicles on the road to ensure safe driving."
