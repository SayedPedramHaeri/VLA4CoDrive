  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.1 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street with multiple braking events. The road is wet and there are tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are parked on the side of the road. There is a red traffic light in the distance and a green street sign on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because there are multiple braking events ahead. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The tall buildings on both sides of the road suggest that this is a busy city street. The driver is paying attention to the traffic light and street signs to ensure that they follow the rules of the road and avoid any accidents."
