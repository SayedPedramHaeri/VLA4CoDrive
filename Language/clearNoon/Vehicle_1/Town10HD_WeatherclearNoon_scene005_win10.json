  "title": "Clear Noon, Moderate-Speed City Driving",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street with moderate traffic and a tall water tower in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.1 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. The traffic is moderate, with a blue car in front of the ego vehicle and a red car parked on the right side of the road. There is a tall water tower in the distance, and the sky is clear. The weather is clearNoon, and the ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed of 8.1 m/s.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on the city street, maintaining a safe distance from the blue car in front of it. It is also keeping an eye on the parked red car on the right side of the road. The tall water tower in the distance serves as a landmark for navigation. The clearNoon weather provides good visibility for safe driving."
