  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a focus on traffic lights and pedestrians.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives through a city intersection, stopping for a red traffic light and yielding to pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving on a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a black car and a parked silver car. The traffic light is red, and the pedestrian crossing light is also red. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue with some clouds.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed and comes to a stop at the red traffic light. It then waits for the pedestrian crossing light to turn green before proceeding. The car is careful to yield to pedestrians and other vehicles in the intersection, ensuring safe navigation through the busy city streets."
