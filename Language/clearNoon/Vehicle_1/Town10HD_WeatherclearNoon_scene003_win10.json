  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side, passing a parked truck and a red bus.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 1 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with a red bus and a parked truck on the right side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians. The traffic lights are visible in the distance, and the road is mostly straight with a slight curve towards the end of the clip.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes frequently, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles or traffic signals. The parked truck and the red bus are visible on the right side of the road, and the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from them. The tall buildings on either side of the road create a canyon-like effect, which may affect the visibility of pedestrians or other obstacles."
