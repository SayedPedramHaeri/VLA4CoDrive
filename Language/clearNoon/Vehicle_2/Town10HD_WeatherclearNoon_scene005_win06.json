  "title": "Clear Noon, Slow City Driving with 24 Braking Events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with 24 braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with 24 braking events. The road is straight and there are no nearby objects of interest. The weather is clear and visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid any potential risks. The 24 braking events suggest that the traffic ahead is congested and the ego vehicle is adjusting its speed accordingly. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front. The clear weather conditions allow for good visibility and the driver can clearly see the road ahead and any nearby objects."
