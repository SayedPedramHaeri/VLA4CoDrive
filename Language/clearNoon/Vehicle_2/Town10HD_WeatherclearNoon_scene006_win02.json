  "title": "Clear Noon, Moderate-Speed City Driving",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street with moderate traffic and a tall brick building on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with a tall brick building on the right. There are several parked cars on the side of the road, and a blue bus is driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and sunny, and there are several traffic lights and street signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving straight on the city street, maintaining a moderate speed and keeping a safe distance from the parked cars on the side of the road. It is prepared to slow down or stop if necessary, for example if a pedestrian were to cross the road or if a blue bus were to turn left in front of it. The tall brick building on the right adds to the urban atmosphere of the scene, and the clear weather conditions make it easier for the ego vehicle to navigate the city streets safely."
