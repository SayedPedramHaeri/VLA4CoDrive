  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 3 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives straight on a city street with palm trees and tall buildings.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.3 m/s). There are 3 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several parked cars on the side of the road. A blue car is driving in front of the ego vehicle. The traffic light is green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from the blue car in front of it. It slows down before reaching the intersection and stops at the red light. It then accelerates and continues driving straight on the one-way street."
