  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 14 braking events.",
  "caption": "The blue car drives down a city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.7 m/s). There are 14 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car drives down a four-lane city street with palm trees on the side. There are other cars on the road, including a red car and a parked black car. The traffic light is green, and there is a roundabout ahead. The weather is clear and sunny, and the road is dry.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car maintains a moderate speed and follows the red car in front of it. It slows down and brakes frequently, possibly due to the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. The car is cautious and attentive, adjusting its speed and direction to ensure safe driving in the city."
