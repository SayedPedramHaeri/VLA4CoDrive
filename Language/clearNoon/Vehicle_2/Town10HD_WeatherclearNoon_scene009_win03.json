  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a focus on traffic lights and pedestrians.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a busy city street, stopping at a red light and waiting for pedestrians to cross.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a wide, straight city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car in front of the ego vehicle. A red truck is parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is red, and the pedestrian crossing light is green. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the blue car in front of it. As the traffic light turns red, the ego vehicle slows down and stops. The pedestrian crossing light is green, indicating that pedestrians have the right of way. The red truck on the side of the road is parked, and the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from it. The tall buildings on both sides of the street create a canyon-like effect, with sunlight filtering through the windows. Overall, the ego vehicle is driving cautiously and attentively, paying close attention to the traffic lights and pedestrians to ensure safe navigation through the city."
