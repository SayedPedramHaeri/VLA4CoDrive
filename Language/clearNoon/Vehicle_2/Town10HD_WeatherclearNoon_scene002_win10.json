  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a focus on traffic and pedestrians.",
  "caption": "A purple sports car drives down a busy city street, with other cars and pedestrians around.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The purple sports car is driving down a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians around. The road is wet, and there are several traffic lights and stop signs along the way. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The purple sports car is driving down the city street, maintaining a moderate speed. It slows down to stop at a red traffic light and then accelerates again. The car changes lanes to overtake a parked truck on the right side of the road. The driver is cautious and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. The car's sensors detect several braking events or strong decelerations ahead, so the driver is prepared to react accordingly."
