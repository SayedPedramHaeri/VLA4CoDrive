The driver is paying attention to the traffic lights and pedestrians to ensure safe driving. The road is wet, which requires extra caution while driving. The driver is also keeping a safe distance from the other cars on the road, including the red car and the parked white truck. The driver is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary to avoid any potential risks."
