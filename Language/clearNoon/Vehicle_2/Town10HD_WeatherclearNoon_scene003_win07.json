  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side, and a red bus drives in the opposite direction.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a red bus driving in the opposite direction. There are tall buildings on either side of the street. The weather is clear and sunny. The traffic lights are visible at the intersection, and they are all green.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, and it slows down before the intersection to prepare for the green light. It then accelerates again after the intersection. The red bus is driving in the opposite direction, and it is maintaining a safe distance from the blue car. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is dense, and the drivers need to be cautious to avoid collisions."
