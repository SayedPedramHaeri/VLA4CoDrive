  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 1 braking event.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with moderate speed and 1 braking event.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). There are 1 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The road is lined with trees and buildings, and there is a traffic light on the left side of the street. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is in a city environment with moderate traffic. The 1 braking event may be due to a car in front of the ego vehicle slowing down or stopping. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road and is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary. The parked truck on the right side of the street may require the ego vehicle to be extra cautious when changing lanes or turning right."
