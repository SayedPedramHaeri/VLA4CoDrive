  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 21 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with palm trees and a red car in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 21 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street with palm trees on either side. There is a red car in the distance and a white van parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is green and the road is wet. The weather is clear and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, following the white van in front of it. It slows down and brakes frequently, possibly due to the wet road conditions. The red car in the distance is also moving slowly, and the green traffic light indicates that it is safe to continue driving. The palm trees on either side of the road add to the urban scenery."
