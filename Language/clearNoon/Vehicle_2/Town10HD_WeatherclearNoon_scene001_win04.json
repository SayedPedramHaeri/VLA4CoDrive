  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with a blue bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.6 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street with a blue bus behind it. There are tall buildings on either side of the street. The road is wet and there are several other cars on the road. The traffic light is green and the pedestrian crossing is empty.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed because it is following the speed limit and there are several other cars on the road. The ego vehicle is braking frequently because it is navigating through a busy city street with tall buildings on either side. The blue bus behind the blue car is maintaining a safe distance because it is following the blue car's speed and trajectory. The ego vehicle is also cautious because there are several other cars on the road and it needs to be aware of potential risks such as sudden braking or hidden pedestrians."
