  "title": "Clear Noon, Slow City Driving with 13 Braking Events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving on the road, and a blue car is parked on the side. The traffic light is red, and there is a tall building in the background. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid collisions with the parked cars and other vehicles on the road. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy, and the ego vehicle is carefully navigating through the congested street. The red traffic light indicates that the ego vehicle should stop, and the tall building in the background adds to the urban environment."
