  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a focus on traffic lights and pedestrians.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with a focus on traffic lights and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving down a city street with a focus on traffic lights and pedestrians. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a parked truck. The road is mostly straight with a few curves, and there are several traffic lights and pedestrian crossings along the way. The weather is clear and sunny, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving down the city street, stopping at red traffic lights and yielding to pedestrians. It then accelerates and continues driving straight, changing lanes when necessary. The driver is cautious and attentive, keeping a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians. The parked truck and the red car are also visible in the video, and the driver needs to be aware of their presence to avoid any potential collisions."
