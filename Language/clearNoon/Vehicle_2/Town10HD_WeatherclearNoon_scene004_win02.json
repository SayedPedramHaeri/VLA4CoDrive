  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side, and a red car drives towards the camera.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with several cars driving in the same direction. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, and it slows down and brakes frequently, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles or pedestrians. The red car driving towards the camera is also driving at a moderate speed, and it maintains a safe distance from the blue car. The tall buildings on either side of the road create a canyon-like effect, which may affect the visibility and driving experience of the drivers. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic situation is dynamic, and the drivers need to be attentive and responsive to avoid collisions."
