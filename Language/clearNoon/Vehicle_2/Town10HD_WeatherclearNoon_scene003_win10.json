  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side, passing a white van and a parked truck.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with a white van and a parked truck on the left side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny, with good visibility. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road, all showing green or no signal.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, following the white van in front of it. It slows down and brakes frequently, possibly due to the presence of the parked truck on the left side of the road. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead to avoid any potential collisions."
