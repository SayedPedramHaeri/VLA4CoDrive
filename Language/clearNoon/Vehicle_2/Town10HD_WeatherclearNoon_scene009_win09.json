  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 9 braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives through a city intersection, with a blue car and a motorcycle nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.2 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving through a busy city intersection. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street. A blue car is driving in the same direction as the red car, while a motorcycle is driving in the opposite direction. There are several traffic lights and pedestrians crossing the street. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving at a moderate speed, following the blue car in front of it. The motorcycle is driving carefully around the intersection, avoiding the pedestrians crossing the street. The ego vehicle slows down and brakes several times to avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians. The driver of the red car is paying close attention to the traffic lights and the surrounding environment to ensure safe driving."
