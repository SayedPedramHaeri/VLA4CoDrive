  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives slowly on a busy city street, surrounded by other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a wide city street with multiple lanes in each direction. There are tall buildings on both sides of the street, and several palm trees lining the sidewalks. The traffic is moderate, with many cars driving around and a few pedestrians crossing the street. The weather is clear and sunny, with good visibility.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the flow of traffic. It slows down when approaching intersections or pedestrian crossings, and accelerates when it's safe to do so. The vehicle's sensors detect the presence of other cars and pedestrians, and it adjusts its speed and direction accordingly to ensure safe driving. The braking events in the metadata indicate that the ego vehicle is prepared to stop or slow down when necessary, to avoid collisions or other potential hazards."
