  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly in a busy city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 15 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street with multiple cars and pedestrians. The weather is clear and sunny. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road. The road is wet from recent rain.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians. The multiple braking events suggest that the traffic is heavy and requires careful navigation. The driver is paying close attention to the road and the surrounding environment to anticipate any potential risks."
