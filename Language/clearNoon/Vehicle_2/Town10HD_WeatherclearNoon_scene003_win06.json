  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side, braking frequently.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.8 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a bus driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and sunny, with good visibility. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and braking frequently, likely due to the high density of other vehicles and pedestrians in the area. The driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid collisions and ensure safe navigation through the city streets. The frequent braking events suggest that the driver is being very careful and defensive, possibly due to the challenging driving conditions in the city."
