  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with multiple braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.7 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly down a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, including a parked truck on the right side of the street. The traffic light is green and there are no pedestrians visible. The road is wet and the weather is clear.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly down the city street because there are multiple braking events ahead. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The parked truck on the right side of the street may be obstructing the view of upcoming traffic or pedestrians, so the driver needs to be extra vigilant. The green traffic light indicates that it is safe to proceed, but the driver should still be prepared for any unexpected situations."
