  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 9 braking events",
  "caption": "A red car drives through a city intersection, stopping at a red light and turning left.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 7.5 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car drives on a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car and a white van. The traffic light is red, and the car stops before turning left. The road is wet, and there is a large truck parked on the side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The red car slows down as it approaches the intersection, stopping at the red light. It then turns left, carefully navigating around the parked truck. The car's braking events and moderate speed suggest cautious driving in a busy urban environment."
