  "title": "Clear Noon, Slow City Driving with 11 Braking Events",
  "caption": "The blue car drives slowly through a city intersection, with a red stop sign on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly through a city intersection. There is a red stop sign on the right side of the road. The road is wet, and there are several parked cars on the left side of the road. The weather is clear, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles in sight.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving slowly through the intersection because there are several parked cars on the left side of the road, and the driver wants to maintain a safe distance. The red stop sign on the right side of the road indicates that the driver must come to a complete stop before proceeding. The wet road surface suggests that there might have been rain recently, so the driver needs to be cautious. The clear weather conditions allow for good visibility, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles in sight, which reduces the risk of accidents."
