  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side, and a white van drives behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with a white van driving behind the blue car. There are several parked cars on the side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, and the driver is likely preparing to stop or make a turn. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic ahead may be congested or there may be a need to slow down for a pedestrian or obstacle. The driver must remain vigilant and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
