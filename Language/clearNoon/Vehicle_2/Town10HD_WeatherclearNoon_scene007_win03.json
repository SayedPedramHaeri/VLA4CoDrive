  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with 10 braking events",
  "caption": "A slow-moving car on a city street with palm trees and a billboard.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car in the distance and a parked white truck. The weather is clear and sunny, and there are no visible traffic lights or pedestrians. The road is mostly straight with a slight curve to the left.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection with a red traffic light. It is also braking frequently due to the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the cars ahead to avoid any potential collisions."
