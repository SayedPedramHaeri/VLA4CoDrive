  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 20 braking events.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with a red car behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.3 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car is driving slowly down a city street with a red car following closely behind. There are several other cars on the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and sunny, and the road is mostly straight with a few gentle curves.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is likely driving at a moderate speed to maintain safety and avoid any sudden braking or maneuvering. The red car behind it seems to be following too closely, which could pose a risk in case of sudden braking or changes in traffic. The driver of the blue car should be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the red car to avoid any accidents."
