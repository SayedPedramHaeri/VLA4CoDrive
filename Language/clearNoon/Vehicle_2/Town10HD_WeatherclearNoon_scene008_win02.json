  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A small blue car drives down a busy city street, with a white bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving in the same direction, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or traffic hazards.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle, a small blue car, is driving at a moderate speed and following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes frequently, possibly due to the busy nature of the city street. The white bus behind it maintains a safe distance, and the other cars on the road also seem to be driving carefully. Overall, the scene appears to be a typical day in a bustling city, with everyone trying to navigate through the traffic safely and efficiently."
