  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a blue three-wheeler.",
  "caption": "A blue three-wheeler drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate with several cars and a blue three-wheeler driving down the street. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and following the blue three-wheeler. It slows down and brakes frequently to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. The tall buildings on either side of the street create a canyon-like effect, which can make it difficult to see pedestrians or other obstacles. The ego vehicle must remain vigilant and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic or environment."
