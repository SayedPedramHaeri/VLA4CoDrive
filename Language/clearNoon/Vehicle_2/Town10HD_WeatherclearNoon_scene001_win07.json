  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a blue sports car.",
  "caption": "A blue sports car drives down a city street with tall buildings and palm trees on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car and a white car. The traffic light is green. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The blue sports car is driving at a moderate speed, following the red car in front of it. It slows down and brakes frequently, possibly due to the presence of pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. The car is careful to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead of it and adjusts its speed accordingly."
