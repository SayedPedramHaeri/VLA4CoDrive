  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 8 braking events.",
  "caption": "The blue car drives straight on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.6 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The blue car drives straight on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees. The road has two lanes in each direction and there are several other cars driving around. The weather is clear and the visibility is good. There are multiple traffic lights and stop signs along the road, and some parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving straight on the city street, maintaining a moderate speed. It slows down and brakes at several points along the road, possibly due to the presence of other vehicles or pedestrians. The car is careful to obey traffic signals and signs, and it keeps a safe distance from other cars on the road. The tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road create a scenic and urban environment for the driver to navigate."
