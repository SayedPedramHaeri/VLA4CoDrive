  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 7 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a busy city street with tall buildings and palm trees.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with 3 lanes. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are driving fast. There is a red double-decker bus parked on the right side of the road. The traffic light is green and there is a crosswalk in the distance. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection. It is also braking frequently because there are many other cars on the road. The driver needs to be cautious and attentive to avoid any accidents. The tall buildings and palm trees suggest that this is a city in a warm climate."
