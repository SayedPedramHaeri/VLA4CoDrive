  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with 9 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with palm trees on both sides, following a blue car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.1 m/s). There are 9 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car that the ego vehicle is following. The weather is clear and sunny, with good visibility. There are no traffic lights or stop signs in the immediate vicinity, but there is a pedestrian crossing the street in the distance.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is following the blue car ahead of it. The driver is being cautious and maintaining a safe distance from the car in front. The numerous braking events suggest that the traffic ahead is stopping frequently, possibly due to pedestrians or other obstacles. The driver needs to be alert and prepared to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation."
