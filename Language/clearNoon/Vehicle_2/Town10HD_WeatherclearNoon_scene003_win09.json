  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings on either side, and a red traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. The traffic is moderate, with several cars and a bus driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue. There are several traffic lights along the road, and the traffic light in the video is red.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, and it slows down to stop at the red traffic light. The frequent braking events suggest that the traffic is dense, and the driver needs to be cautious to avoid collisions. The tall buildings on either side of the road create a canyon-like effect, which can make it difficult to see pedestrians or other vehicles. The driver needs to be vigilant and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid accidents."
