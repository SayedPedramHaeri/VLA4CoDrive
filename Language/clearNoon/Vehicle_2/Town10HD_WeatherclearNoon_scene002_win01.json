  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a blue car in the foreground.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a city street with tall buildings and palm trees on either side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 25 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several other cars on the road, including a red truck and a white car. The traffic light is green, and there is a crosswalk in the distance. The weather is clear and sunny, and the visibility is good.",
  "reasoning": "The blue car is driving at a moderate speed, following the red truck in front of it. It slows down as it approaches the crosswalk, preparing to turn left. The driver is cautious and keeps a safe distance from the other vehicles on the road. The tall buildings and palm trees on either side of the street create a scenic view for the driver."
