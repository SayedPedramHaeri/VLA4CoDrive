  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A blue car drives down a busy city street with tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.1 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several cars and a bus on the road. The traffic light is green. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The blue car changes lanes to overtake a slower vehicle. The tall buildings and palm trees on the side of the road indicate that the ego vehicle is driving in a city environment."
