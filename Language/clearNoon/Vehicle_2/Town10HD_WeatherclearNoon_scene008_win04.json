  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with 6 braking events.",
  "caption": "A white and blue bus drives down a busy city street with a red car following it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.4 m/s). There are 6 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several cars and a bus driving down the street. The weather is clear and sunny. The traffic is moderate and there are no visible traffic lights or stop signs.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, following the white and blue bus. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The red car following the bus is maintaining a safe distance. The bus is turning left at the next intersection, and the ego vehicle adjusts its speed and direction accordingly."
