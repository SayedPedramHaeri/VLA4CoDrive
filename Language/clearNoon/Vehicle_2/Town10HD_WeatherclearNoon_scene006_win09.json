  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with frequent braking.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 18 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with frequent braking. The road is straight and has two lanes. There are several other cars on the road, including a blue car in the adjacent lane and a red car in the distance. There are also palm trees lining the street and a tall building in the background. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain a safe distance from the blue car in the adjacent lane. It frequently brakes to avoid collisions with other vehicles or obstacles on the road. The presence of palm trees and the tall building in the background suggest that the ego vehicle is driving in a commercial or urban area. The clear weather conditions allow for good visibility and easy navigation of the road."
