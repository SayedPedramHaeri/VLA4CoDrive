  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 7 braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives through a city intersection, with a bus and a blue car behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 2 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.8 m/s). There are 7 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The scene takes place at a city intersection with a bus stop and a tall building in the background. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and pedestrian crossings. The ego vehicle is a red car driving slowly and changing lanes. There are other cars on the road, including a blue car and a parked white van. The traffic lights are mostly green and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving through the intersection because the traffic light is green and there is no oncoming traffic. The ego vehicle slows down and changes lanes to avoid a parked white van. The ego vehicle is cautious and brakes several times because of the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians. The ego vehicle is also following the blue car at a safe distance."
