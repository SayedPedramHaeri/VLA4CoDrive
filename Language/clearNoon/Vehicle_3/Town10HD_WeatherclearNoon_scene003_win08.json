  "title": "Clear Noon, Moderate-Speed City Driving with 30 Braking Events",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a city street with tall buildings on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a city street with tall buildings on the side of the road. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are parked on the side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny, and there are no visible traffic lights or stop signs. The road is mostly straight with a few curves near the intersections.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving at a moderate speed, following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes frequently, likely in response to the presence of other vehicles on the road. The driver of the red car is being cautious and attentive, paying attention to the movements of other cars and pedestrians. The tall buildings on the side of the road suggest that this is a downtown area with high-density urban development."
