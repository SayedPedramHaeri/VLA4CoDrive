  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a city street with tall buildings and a parked truck on the right.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a city street with tall buildings on both sides. There is a parked truck on the right side of the street. The road is wet and there is a traffic light on the left side of the street. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and frequently braking to maintain safety. The presence of the parked truck on the right side of the street may require the driver to be extra cautious. The wet road surface could also be a contributing factor to the frequent braking. The driver is likely following traffic rules and regulations to ensure safe driving."
