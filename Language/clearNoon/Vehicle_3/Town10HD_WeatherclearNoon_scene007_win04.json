  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 12 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with palm trees on both sides, following a red car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.5 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a 4-lane city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car that the ego vehicle is following. The weather is clear and sunny, and there are no visible traffic lights or pedestrians. The ego vehicle is moving slowly, with an average speed of 3.5 m/s.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to maintain a safe distance from the red car in front of it. It slows down or brakes 12 times in this window, possibly to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The clear weather conditions allow for good visibility, and the absence of traffic lights suggests that the ego vehicle is relying on its own sensors and decision-making algorithms to navigate the road safely."
