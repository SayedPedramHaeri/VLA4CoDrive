  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a green traffic light.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with a green traffic light.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). No significant braking is observed in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street with a green traffic light. There are other cars parked on the side of the road and a tall building in the background. The road is wet and there are trees on the sidewalk.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because the traffic light is green and there is no immediate need to stop or slow down. The driver is keeping a safe distance from the parked cars and the tall building in the background. The wet road could potentially cause the vehicle to skid, so the driver needs to be cautious and maintain control of the vehicle."
