  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 19 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with tall buildings and palm trees on the sidewalk.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.8 m/s). There are 19 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several other cars on the road, some of them are driving faster than the ego vehicle. There is a red car parked on the side of the road. The traffic light is green.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly because it is approaching an intersection. It is also braking frequently because there are many other cars on the road. The driver needs to be cautious and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead to avoid collisions."
