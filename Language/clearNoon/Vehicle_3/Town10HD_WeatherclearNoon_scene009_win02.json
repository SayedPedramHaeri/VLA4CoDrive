  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a red car in front.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a busy city street with a bus behind it.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several cars and a bus driving down the street. The traffic light is red and there is a pedestrian crossing the street. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving behind a red car and maintaining a safe distance. The bus behind the ego vehicle is also driving at a moderate speed. The pedestrian crossing the street is visible to the ego vehicle and the traffic light is red, indicating that the ego vehicle should stop. The ego vehicle is prepared to brake or change lanes if necessary to avoid any potential risks."
