  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 13 braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives through an intersection in a city street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.4 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The video shows a red car driving through an intersection in a city street. The road is wet and there are several other cars and pedestrians around. The traffic light is green and the weather is clear. The ego vehicle is moving slowly and changing lanes.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly through the intersection because there are several other cars and pedestrians around. It is changing lanes to get to its desired destination. The 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the traffic is quite heavy and the driver needs to be cautious to avoid collisions."
