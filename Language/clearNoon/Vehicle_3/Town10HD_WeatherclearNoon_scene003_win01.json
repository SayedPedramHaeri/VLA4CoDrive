  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a red car in the distance.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a city street with other cars parked on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.2 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with a speed limit of 30 mph. The traffic is moderate with a few cars driving in the opposite direction. The weather is clear and sunny. There are several traffic lights and street signs along the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and following the red car in the distance. It slows down when approaching a traffic light and stops when the light turns red. The ego vehicle changes lanes to overtake a parked truck and then changes back to the original lane. It maintains a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
