  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a city street with tall buildings on the side of the road.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a city street with tall buildings on the side of the road. There are several other cars on the road, some of which are parked on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and stop signs visible. The weather is clear and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving at a moderate speed and frequently braking to avoid collisions with other vehicles on the road. The driver is being cautious and paying attention to the traffic signals and pedestrians on the road. The tall buildings on the side of the road suggest that this is a busy city area with a lot of traffic."
