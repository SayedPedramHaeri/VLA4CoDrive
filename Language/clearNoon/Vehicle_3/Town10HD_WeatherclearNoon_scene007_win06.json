  "title": "Moderate-speed city driving on a clear day, with 12 braking events or strong decelerations.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a busy city street, following a red car and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 5.1 m/s). There are 12 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a wide, straight city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car that the ego vehicle is following. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians. There are several traffic lights and stop signs along the road, all of which are visible and in the off position.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the red car in front of it. It occasionally changes lanes to pass slower vehicles or to avoid obstacles on the road. The driver is cautious and attentive, braking early for traffic lights and stop signs. The weather is clear and sunny, which improves visibility and reduces the risk of accidents. Overall, the driving environment is relatively safe and predictable."
