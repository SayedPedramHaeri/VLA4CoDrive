  "title": "Clear Noon, Slow City Driving with 20 Braking Events",
  "caption": "Red car driving slowly on a city street with multiple parked cars and a stop sign.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 2.4 m/s). There are 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving slowly on a city street with multiple parked cars on the side of the road. There is a stop sign ahead and a blue car in the distance. The weather is clear and sunny, and the road is dry.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to ensure safety and avoid any potential accidents. The presence of multiple parked cars and the upcoming stop sign require the driver to be extra cautious. The blue car in the distance is also moving slowly, indicating that the traffic situation is calm. The 20 braking events or strong decelerations in this window suggest that the driver is being very careful and is prepared to stop at any moment."
