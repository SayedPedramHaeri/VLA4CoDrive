  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a city street with tall buildings and a parked truck on the side.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a city street with tall buildings on both sides. There is a parked truck on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and stop signs along the way. The weather is clear and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and frequently braking to avoid collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians. The parked truck on the side of the road may have obstructed the ego vehicle's lane, forcing the driver to slow down and change lanes. The presence of several traffic lights and stop signs along the way indicates that the driver needs to be cautious and attentive to traffic rules and regulations."
