  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 26 braking events.",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 1.0 m/s). There are 26 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car is driving on a busy city street with other cars and pedestrians. The road is wet, and there are several traffic lights and signs. The weather is clear, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is driving at a moderate speed, following the flow of traffic. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians. The driver is cautious and attentive, paying close attention to the road and the surroundings. The car's sensors detect the presence of other cars, pedestrians, and obstacles, and the driver adjusts the speed and direction accordingly. The car's headlights and turn signals are on, indicating the driver's intentions to other road users."
