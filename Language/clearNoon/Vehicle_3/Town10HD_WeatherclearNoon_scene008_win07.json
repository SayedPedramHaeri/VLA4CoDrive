  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a busy city street with tall buildings on either side, following a black car.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several other cars on the road, including a black car that the red car is following. The weather is clear and sunny, and there are several traffic lights and pedestrians visible on the sidewalks. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, with an average speed of 0.0 m/s and 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The red car is following the black car at a moderate speed, and there are several other cars on the road. The ego vehicle is almost stopped, likely due to the presence of the black car ahead of it. The tall buildings on either side of the street create a canyon-like effect, which may affect visibility and driving behavior. The presence of multiple traffic lights and pedestrians on the sidewalks suggests that the road is in a busy urban area, and the driver must be cautious and attentive to avoid accidents."
