  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 8 braking events",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a busy city street, following a red car and changing lanes.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 6.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a 4-lane city street with parked cars on the right side. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car that the ego vehicle is following. The weather is clear and sunny, with no visible obstacles or pedestrians. The traffic lights are green, and there are no visible stop signs or crossings.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed, following the red car ahead. It changes lanes to pass a parked truck on the right side of the road. The 8 braking events in the driving metadata suggest that the ego vehicle is reacting to sudden changes in traffic or pedestrians crossing the road. The driver must remain vigilant and prepared to brake or change direction quickly to ensure safe driving in this busy city environment."
