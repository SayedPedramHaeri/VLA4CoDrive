  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with moderate speed and two braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.4 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car parked on the side of the road. The road is wet, and there is a large building in the background. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is in a city environment with moderate traffic. The two braking events could be due to the presence of pedestrians or other vehicles on the road. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and adjusting its speed accordingly to ensure safe driving."
