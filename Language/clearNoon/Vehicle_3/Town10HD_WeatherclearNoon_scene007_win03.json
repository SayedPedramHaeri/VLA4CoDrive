  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with 11 braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with palm trees and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.6 m/s). There are 11 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a two-lane city street with palm trees on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a red sports car and a parked blue car. The traffic light is green, and there is a crosswalk with a pedestrian nearby. The weather is clear and sunny, and the sky is blue with some clouds.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and carefully, maintaining a safe distance from the other cars on the road. It slows down or brakes frequently, possibly due to the presence of pedestrians and the need to navigate the busy city street. The driver is cautious and attentive, paying close attention to the traffic light and the surrounding environment to ensure safe driving."
