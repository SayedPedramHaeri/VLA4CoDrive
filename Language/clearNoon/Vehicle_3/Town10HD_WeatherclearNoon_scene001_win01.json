  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "Red car driving on a busy city street with tall buildings and a tall skyscraper in the distance.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.3 m/s). There are 24 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with tall buildings on both sides. The traffic is moderate with several cars and a bus driving on the opposite side of the road. The weather is clear and sunny. There are multiple traffic lights and a few parked cars on the side of the road.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and frequently braking to avoid collisions with other vehicles. The tall buildings and the tall skyscraper in the distance give an impression of a bustling city. The parked cars on the side of the road indicate that there might be some nearby parking area. The traffic lights and the bus suggest that this is a busy city street with a well-organized traffic system."
