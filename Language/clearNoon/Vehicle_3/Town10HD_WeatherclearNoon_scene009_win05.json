  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a red car and a bus nearby.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a city street with a bus and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The red car drives down a busy city street with a bus and other cars. The road is wet and there are several traffic lights and pedestrians on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and following the red car in front of it. It slows down and brakes frequently to avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians. The bus and other cars on the road also follow traffic rules and maintain safe distances from each other."
