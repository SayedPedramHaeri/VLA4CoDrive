  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with frequent braking.",
  "caption": "A white bus drives down a busy city street with a green car following.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 3.9 m/s). There are 13 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other vehicles on the road, including a red car and a parked white van. The traffic light is green, and there are tall buildings in the background. The weather is clear and sunny, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly and following the white bus. It slows down or brakes frequently, possibly due to the busy traffic and the need to maintain a safe distance from the bus. The green car is positioned behind the bus, and it appears to be following the bus closely. The parked white van on the side of the road may be obstructing the view of the road ahead, which could be a potential safety concern for the ego vehicle."
