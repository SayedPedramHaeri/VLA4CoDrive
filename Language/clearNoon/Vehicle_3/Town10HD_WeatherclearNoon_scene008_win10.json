  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a red car and a bus nearby.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving on a busy city street with a red car and a bus nearby.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with multiple lanes and parked cars on the side. There are several other cars driving on the road, including a red car and a bus. The traffic light is green, and there are tall buildings in the background. The weather is clear and sunny, and the sky is blue.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed and following the red car in front of it. It is keeping a safe distance from the car in front and is prepared to brake if necessary. The bus is driving on the opposite side of the road, and the parked cars on the side of the road are not obstructing the flow of traffic. The traffic light is green, and the ego vehicle is following the traffic rules. The tall buildings in the background suggest that this is a busy commercial area."
