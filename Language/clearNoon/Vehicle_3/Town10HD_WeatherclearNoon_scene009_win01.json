  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with a red car and a bus nearby.",
  "caption": "A red car drives down a busy city street with a bus and other cars.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is almost stopped (average speed ≈ 0.0 m/s). There are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several cars and a bus driving down the street. The traffic is moderate and the weather is clear. The ego vehicle is driving almost stopped and there are 30 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving almost stopped to maintain a safe distance from the red car in front of it. The bus and other cars are also driving down the street, following the traffic rules. The weather is clear, which allows for good visibility. The ego vehicle is carefully navigating the busy street to avoid any potential risks."
