  "title": "Clear noon, moderate-speed city driving with two braking events.",
  "caption": "The ego vehicle drives down a city street with moderate speed and two braking events.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed (average speed ≈ 8.2 m/s). There are 2 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving down a city street with moderate speed. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car in the distance and a parked truck on the right side of the road. The road is lined with palm trees and there are traffic lights at the intersection. The weather is clear and there is no rain or fog.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving at a moderate speed because it is in a city environment with moderate traffic. It slows down and brakes twice in this window, possibly because of the presence of other vehicles or pedestrians. The ego vehicle is careful to follow traffic rules and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road."
