  "title": "Clear noon, slow city driving with multiple braking events.",
  "caption": "A red car drives in front of a bus on a city street.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.0 m/s). There are 8 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with tall buildings on both sides. There are several other cars on the road, including a red car in front of the bus. The traffic light is green, and there are palm trees on the sidewalk. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid any sudden braking events. It maintains a safe distance from the red car in front of it, which is also slowing down. The bus is also moving slowly, and the tall buildings on both sides of the street create a canyon-like effect that may affect visibility. The green traffic light indicates that it is safe to continue driving, but the ego vehicle remains cautious due to the multiple braking events in the area."
