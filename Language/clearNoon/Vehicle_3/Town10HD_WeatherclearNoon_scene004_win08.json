  "caption": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly on a city street with many parked cars and pedestrians.",
  "context": "This clip is from ego vehicle index 3 in the CARLA simulation. Weather is clear (clearNoon). The ego vehicle is moving slowly (average speed ≈ 4.9 m/s). There are 10 braking events or strong decelerations in this window.",
  "description": "The road is a one-way street with two lanes. There are several parked cars on the right side of the road. The traffic light is green, and there is a large building in the background. The weather is clear and sunny.",
  "reasoning": "The ego vehicle is driving slowly to avoid any sudden braking or obstacles. It is keeping a safe distance from the parked cars and pedestrians on the sidewalk. The driver is paying close attention to the traffic light and the large building in the background to anticipate any changes in the traffic situation."
