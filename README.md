## 🔍 Overview
<p align="justify">
We introduce VLA4CoDrive, a cooperative Vision–Language–Action dataset with synchronized multi-vehicle sensing across diverse driving environments, providing multi-view visual streams, contextual text (caption, context, description, reasoning), and future trajectory actions for training and evaluating VLA driving models.
